These included  junior and senior clinicians, researchers (on drug resistance), government health officials and workers, and also students who are currently involved in the study of HIV and TB drug resistance. ', '<p>This also included 37 invited senior presenters from the WHO, Stanford, UFS, Brazil, and the Africa Centre, to name a few. <b><i> \'If you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far, go together. We need to go far, very fast\' </b></i> -  this modified African proverb set the course for SATuRN and its partners in reaffirming the possibilities and heights that can be reached through combining individual efforts to create a solid network. </p>\r<p>The SADC region in Africa is home to 4 % of the global population; unfortunately, it is also home to 40 % of the people living with HIV/AIDS in the world. One of the goals of governments in this region is to reach a sustainable, equitable and socio-economic development that will lead to the alleviation of poverty. However,  the rate at which the epidemic of HIV/AIDS has spread has seen most of these objectives delayed, if not halted. Over the past two decades, most governments in the SADC region have unanimously recognised the need for and the significance of providing Anti-retro rivals (ARVs) to patients infected with HIV/AIDS. This progressive approach has led to a rising number of people initiated on Anti-retroviral Treatment (ART). Unfortunately, this achievement could soon be compromised by the lingering ghost called drug resistance. It is true that all viruses, through defaulting/failing treatment, develop resistance to particular drugs. HIV is no exception in this; a rising number of patients on ART are failing treatment. Rising concerns about the ever increasing failure rate and determination to lay this ghost to rest led the Southern African Resistance Network (SATuRN) to host its 6th Workshop on HIV/TB drug resistance in Gabarone, Botswana.</p>\r<p>After the success of the workshops held at the University of Western Cape in 2008 and at the University of the Free State in 2009 and 2010, the Botswana workshop followed the same successful format. It covered presentations of Anti-Retroviral treatment (ART) programmes and clinical cases management. The workshop also expanded to cover TB resistance. The general consensus, as was echoed by Dr Refeletsoe Lebelonyane,* the Director of the Health Ministry of Botswana, was that HIV drug resistance and TB resistance should be talked about on the same platform. Dr. Lebelonyane also ended by saying <b><i>\'...how we cope with these challenges will determine our success in future\' </b></i>. The achievements and success of the workshop were also accompanied by the launch of an open access HIV/TB Drug Resistance and Clinical Management Case Book designed to help clinicians to better understand resistance and virus mutations. This was also coupled by a SATuRN/Life Technologies Genotype Manual for laboratory use.</p>\r<p>The Southern African Resistance Network (SATuRN) has been a champion in the campaign for promoting collaborative efforts between virologists, researchers, clinicians, medical personnel and policy makers in the SADC region and across the globe. SATuRN currently includes 24 research partners in Southern Africa and has collected over 3,200 resistance genotypes linked to treatment and clinical information. To collect, curate, interpret, and disseminate sequence and drug resistance data, SATuRN has installed the two best HIV drug resistance databases in the world (the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database and RegaDB clinical Management and Drug Resistance Database) in South Africa and Botswana. </p>\r<p>This workshop was sponsored by the Botswana Ministry of Health in collaboration with Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies, The South African Medical Research Council (MRC),The Southern African Treatment and Resistance Network (SATuRN) in collaboration with Life Technologies, the European Commission (EC), the Canadian International Development Agency (IDRC), the Wellcome Trust and the US PEPFAR/CDC.</p>\r', 'Tulio de Oliveira, Lungani Ndwandwe', 'id8HIVDRWorkshop.png', 3, 'Botswana hosted a successful HIV and TB workshop', '2011-12-01', 'imgworkshop2011c.png', 'Botswana, hosted, successful, HIV , TB, drug resistance, workshop', 'Botswana hosted a successful HIV and TB workshop.

(3, NULL, '<p><a href=\"#paper\">A recent paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases </a>has provided full details of the national anti-TB drug resistance survey in Swaziland performed in 2009-2010. The results are quite alarming and there is detailed information within the report that should challenge us to rethink current strategies for diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant TB not only in Swaziland but elsewhere in Southern Africa.</p>\r', '<p><b>TB in Swaziland</b></p>\r<p>The Kingdom of Swaziland is a small country (population 1,185,000) with the highest incidence rates of TB in the world. The estimated annual incidence of TB disease in 2010 was 1,287 per 100,000 giving an estimated 15,000 cases per year. Approximately 80% of TB cases are HIV-infected. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>Case detection rates and cure rates are below targets set by the World Health Organization. Case detection rate in 2010 was 66% (target 70%) and the cure rate for new smear positive cases in 2009 was only 51% (target 85%). In 2010 there were 326 confirmed cases of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), but only 2% of new cases and 35% of previously treated cases were tested for drug resistance. There is one laboratory performing culture and first-line drug susceptibility testing (DST), and second-line DST is performed outside the country. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p><b>The survey</b></p>\r<p>A nationwide cross-sectional survey was performed, enrolling 840 smear positive cases >14 years old from TB diagnostic centres. The cases were defined either as new cases (no previous TB treatment or anti-TB drugs for <1 month duration) or previously treated cases (anti-TB drugs for >1 month duration). The survey achieved excellent coverage, with about 84% of potentially eligible individuals screened for the survey. DST for first-line drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and streptomycin) was performed on all culture positive samples. DST for second-line drugs (amikacin, capreomycin, ofloxacin, 4-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), and ethionamide) was performed on isolates resistant to rifampicin and/or isoniazid. In addition, pyrazinamide susceptibility was tested for isolates resistant to any first-line drug and moxifloxacin susceptibility was tested for isolates resistant to ofloxacin. DST results were available for 633 patients (75% of those enrolled). </p>\r<p></p>\r<p><b>Key findings</b></p><b>\r<p> - The proportion with MDR was 7.7% (27/352) in new cases and 33.8% (95/281) in previously treated cases</p>\r<p> - 68.9% (84/122) of MDR isolates were resistant to pyrazinamide</p>\r<p> - 47.5% (58/122) of MDR isolates were resistant to ethionamide </p>\r<p> - 9.0% (11/122) of MDR isolates were resistant to either ofloxacin or a second-line injectable (pre-XDR)</p>\r<p> -  0.8% (1/122) of MDR strains were resistant to both ofloxacin and a second-line injectable (XDR)</p></b>\r<p><b>Context</b></p>\r<p>The prevalence of MDR-TB in this survey was considerably higher than in the previous national survey performed in 1995. It is also considerably higher than reported from other Southern Africa countries. Botswana is the only country in Southern Africa to have performed regular national drug resistance surveys. As can be seen in the figures below, in the last Botswana survey in 2008 the prevalence of MDR in both new cases and previously treated cases had increased from previous surveys but not to the extent described now in Swaziland.</p>\n<img src=\"imagesBIO/blog3img.png\"><br>\n\n<p><b>Implications for diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB</b></p>\r<p>This survey highlights the pressing need for improved diagnostic strategies for drug resistance. In this regard, it is encouraging that several initiatives to assist with TB control are in place within the country, e.g. <a href=\"#expand\">the EXPAND-TB project</a> and < a href=\"#MSF\"> Medecins sans Frontieres</a>. According to the <a href=\"#who\">WHO monitoring of Xpert MTB/RIF roll-out</a>, Swaziland has procured 20 GeneXpert modules and 5,100 Xpert MTB/RIF cartridges with <a href=\"#expansion\">plans for further expansion of this technology</a>. </p>\r<p><b>Implications for use of Xpert MTB/RIF</b></p>\r<p>There are interesting details within this paper that could help to inform the use of Xpert MTB/RIF and which highlight some limitations of the technology. The detection of rifampicin resistance is considered a good proxy for the presence of MDR and this is supported by the evidence in this survey: the proportion of RIF-resistant strains that were also resistant to INH was 93.8% (122/130) so rifampicin mono-resistance was rare. </p>\r<p>On the other hand, the proportion of strains that were INH-resistant but not RIF-resistant was quite high (52 isolates, 8.2% of total). The implication of this is that if Xpert detects no rifampicin resistance and no other DST is performed, undetected INH resistance will potentially lead to poor outcomes and the emergence of MDR strains on standard first-line therapy.</p>\r<p><b>Implications for standardised drug regimens for MDR-TB</b></p>\r<p>In terms of drug regimens for MDR-TB, the findings of high levels ethionamide resistance in the MDR strains should be of huge concern not only in Swaziland but throughout Southern Africa. Ethionamide resistance may partly arise due to cross-resistance from inhA mutations selected by isoniazid. Ethionamide is considered a key element of the standardised MDR treatment regimen yet this data would suggest that in half of all cases, it is likely to be an ineffective component of the regimen. WHO guidelines suggest that a standardised MDR regimen should consist of a fluoroquinolone, an injectable, ethionamide, and either cycloserine/terizidone or PAS. This data would suggest that ethionamide cannot be relied upon as an active drug and it might be necessary to include both cycloserine/terizidone and PAS in a standardised regimen. It seems that this is indeed the recommendation in the <a href=#swazi\">Swaziland national guidelines</a> but <a href=\"#ZA\">South African guidelines</a> are more in parallel with the WHO guidance. There is an urgent need in South Africa for up-to-date representative data to inform treatment guidelines. </p>\r<p>Although pyrazinamide is not considered an active drug in an MDR treatment regimen, it is recommended as a component of a standardised regimen to take advantage of its activity in an acidic environment (as in chronically inflamed lung tissue sometimes seen in MDR-TB cases). One also has to question this rationale if the drug will be ineffective in almost two-thirds of cases. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p><b>Conclusion</p></b>\r<p>This paper is very important and highlights the importance of surveillance for drug resistance. Better surveillance systems are required in many countries and there is a need to assimilate all the data to inform drug-resistant TB control strategies in the region.  </p>\r<p></p>\r<p><b>References and links</p></b>\r<p><a name=\"paper\"></a><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid1801.110850\">Sanchez-Padilla E et al.

(2, NULL, '<p>A recently published report of tuberculosis strains resistant to all tested first- and second-line anti-TB drugs in Mumbai has garnered much attention in the media. What has actually been reported: Is this a new form of TB? What is the significance for global TB control?</p>', '<p><b>The report</b></p>\r<p>The <a href=\"#correspondence\"> correspondence in Clinical Infectious Diseases </a> describes four adults with M. tuberculosis isolates resistant to all tested first- and second-line drugs. All four patients had been previously treated with first-line drugs and for at least 12 months with one or more second-line agent. The timing of any specific diagnosis of MDR-TB or XDR-TB and the relation to the treatment provided in the four cases is not made clear. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed for the following drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin, amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin, para-aminosalicylate (PAS), and ethionamide. Genotypic analysis (with the <a href=#assay\">Genotype MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl assays</a>) gave supportive evidence of mutations conferring resistance to rifampicin (rpoB), isoniazid (katG/inhA), fluoroquinolones (gyrA), and injectables (rrs). Interestingly, there is no mention of embB mutations (which can be detected by the MTBDRsl assay) for any of the four patients, although the assay is known to be less reliable in detecting ethambutol resistance.</p>\r<p></p>\r<p><b>Is this a novel finding?</b></p>\r<p>The simple answer is no. There have been previous reports of M. tuberculosis strains resistant to all tested first- and second-line drugs. Terms used previously include <b><i>\'extremely drug-resistant TB (XXDR-TB)\', \'super extensively drug-resistant TB\'</b></i>, and the term used in this report, <b><i>\'totally drug-resistant TB\'</b></i>. In 2007,<a href=\"#migli\"> Migliori <i>et al.</i> </a>reported XDR-TB cases from Italy with additional phenotypic  resistance to PAS and ethionamide, i.e. the same pattern as the isolates in the Mumbai report. In 2009 <a href=\"#vela\">Velayati <i>et al.</i></a> reported 15 patients with phenotypic resistance to all the tested first- and second-line agents (this included DST for cycloserine which was not performed for the Mumbai cases). Since the publication of this Indian report many TB physicians have argued that similar cases have been seen in their practice, usually in XDR-TB patients who fail treatment. It should be noted that the term <b><i>\'totally drug-resistant TB</b></i> has not been recognised by the WHO for reasons outlined here.</p>\r<p></p>\r<p><b>So why so much attention? </b>  </p>\r<p>The fact that this report originates from India is clearly important. India, with 1.5 million TB cases in 2009, accounts for about a quarter of all TB cases worldwide and is estimated to have a similar proportion of global MDR-TB cases. There is a huge gap between estimated MDR-TB cases and notified cases (only 2.3% of estimated cases were notified in 2009). There is a huge shortage in laboratory capacity for culture and drug resistance testing (one lab per 50 million population) so access to diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant TB is extremely limited. Budgets for MDR-TB are inadequate and it is concerning to note that the Global Fund is the main source of funding for the MDR-TB budget. The latest <a href=\"#who\">WHO MDR/XDR-TB progress report </a>highlights significant expansion of laboratory capacity for diagnosis of drug-resistant TB (see p13 of report) yet it is clear that huge challenges exist in India. Seen in this context, it is not surprising that this report has been used to stress the dangers of inadequate attention to drug-resistant TB. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p><b>Who is to blame for these drug-resistant cases?</b></p>\r<p>The authors of the report point the finger of blame on private practitioners who provided treatment to the four cases. It would seem that private doctors are easy scapegoats but surely they are not the main source of the problem. The patients described in the report presumably sought care in the private sector because they had limited or no access to diagnosis or treatment in the public health system. There is a need for significant scale-up of diagnostic and treatment services for drug-resistant TB worldwide and simultaneous investment in research and development to generate better tools with which to manage the disease. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p><b>What is the relevance for global TB control?</b></p>\r<p>TB is a global disease and drug resistant strains emerge in all settings. XDR-TB has been reported from 69 countries and so the potential exists for the emergence of cases similar to those reported from India. Drug-resistant TB also spreads internationally, as highlighted recently in a <a href=\"#gram\">paper from our colleague Graham Cooke</a> at Imperial College, London. In this report, MDR-TB was diagnosed in London in a South African immigrant and both the patient and the isolate could be linked to the outbreak of drug-resistant TB centred on Tugela Ferry in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. This emphasises that drug-resistant TB must not be seen as a problem constrained to certain countries, but rather as a broader challenge for global health.  </p><br>\r<p><b>References and links</b></p>\r<p><a name=\"correspondence\"></a>Udwadia ZF et al. <a href=\"http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/11/24/cid.cir889.extract\">Totally drug-resistant tuberculosis in India.

(6, NULL, '<p><b><i>What factors contribute to young people / adolescents on Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Treatment (HAART) failing treatment?</b></i> Quite a number of factors really, such as, lack of knowledge about the advantages of taking treatment, or the lack of knowledge about the length of time one is required to be on treatment. In fact, there are a number of factors that come into play, most of which are psychological and socio-economical in nature. Perhaps one underlying factor that seems to surface out of all of this, and that perhaps goes hand in hand with the factors mentioned above, is the notion that, for an adolescent, living life with HIV is a very long and lonely life. Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) social workers from Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies work with adolescents as part of the Hlabisa HIV and Care Treatment Program. In the end of 2011 they have organized many activities, including a four day workshop during the school holidays. targeted at adolescents, aged 12+ on ART, most of whom were failing ART. The aim of the workshop was to provide sufficient information to enhance adherence and to provide a support system.</p>', '<p><b><i>\'More information was needed about HIV drug resistance, and to let the participants know that ART is a life-long commitment\'</b></i>, these words were expressed by Pretty Nkosi and Nokuthula Skhosana, the ART social workers from Africa Centre and the main organizers of the workshop. They continued to say; <b><i>\'...having a sort of group setting with group discussions by teenagers sharing and facing more or less similar challenges, gives them (adolescents) an assurance that they are not alone in their circumstance and that they have support\'</b></i>. The 4 day programme of the workshop was designed to cater to the audience through infotainment sessions.</p>\r<p>The sessions ranged from self-reflecting exercises, where teenagers were required to do introspective exercises by looking in the mirror and expressing their feelings through group discussions; to an informative but fun session about ARVs, amasotsha (CD4) and HIV drug resistance by Dr Tulio de Oliviera (Africa Centre/SATuRN). Also included in the programme was an HIV activist, who had lived with HIV for more than 10 years, telling his story about his life with HIV. This reaffirming story confirming the fact that HIV is not a death sentence anymore and that one can live a long and a healthy life.</p>\r<p>Returning to the first line of this article, the question still remains, <b><i>\'how do we keep patients from failing treatment?\'</b></i>; further more how do we keep adolescents from failing treatment as they are  treatment naive, impoverished, and in most cases depressed.  Sometimes the antidote is not always clinical. It became apparent from the programme that this knowledge dispensing exercise was not a mechanical exercise, where one gives and another receives; more can be learned from these children, who know first hand about their experiences. So creating an environment where one learns from them too would ultimately shape the direction of research and interventions. All of the above make the work of social workers at the ART programme relevant, informative, and very need necessary.</p>\r<p>Part of the social activities for adolescents organized by the social workers in this report was funded by their own personel funds.

(9, NULL, '<p>The diagnosis of drug resistance in pulmonary TB generally relies on performing susceptibility tests either directly on sputum specimens or on the isolate grown in sputum culture. An interesting article in Clinical Infectious Diseases addresses the question of whether the susceptibility pattern in sputum tells the whole story. </p>', '<p><b><i>Figure 1 - </b></i>These diagrams represent populations of M. tuberculosis bacilli within a lung cavity (large circle). Drug-resistant bacilli are present; the predominant population being resistant to drugs A& B. Due to spontaneous mutations, there are bacilli present with additional resistance to drugs C & D. <p>They report a case series, from a referral centre in the Republic of Georgia, of 50 drug-resistant TB cases that had undergone surgical lung resection and had paired sputum and lung tissue specimens, specifically from a lung cavity. The patients had been treated for drug-resistant TB for an average of just over one year. The specimens were cultured using either solid (Lowenstein-Jensen medium) or liquid (MGIT 960) media. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) for first- and second-line drugs was performed using the concentration method. </p>\r<p>Eighteen patients (36%) had a positive culture with DST results from both the pre-operative sputum specimen and lung tissue. In seven of these cases DST revealed additional resistance in the lung tissue isolate compared to the isolate cultured from sputum. In four cases this included extra resistance to the fluoroquinolone (ofloxacin) and in three cases this included extra resistance to injectable agents (kanamycin or capreomycin). Overall in four cases the sputum isolate would have been classified as pre-XDR whereas the tissue isolate would have been classified as XDR-TB. </p>\r<p>How can we explain these findings? This study was unable to confirm that the strains in sputum and lung tissue were identical (no genetic analysis was performed) so it is possible that this represented mixed strains within the same patient. However, a previous similar study did demonstrate identical strains but with different susceptibility patterns in sputum and lung tissue.</p>\r<p>It is well known that the compartmentalisation of bacilli promotes the acquisition of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis as certain drugs are more active in different environments. The penetration of second-line drugs into lung tissue, particularly lung cavities, is poorly understood. It is possible that differential penetration of drugs into the lung cavities predisposes to the emergence of further drug resistance in those populations (see Figure). </p>\r<p>Does this have any relevance for the diagnosis and management of drug-resistant TB? It is clearly neither practical nor desirable to obtain lung tissue for culture for all drug-resistant TB patients! But we should remember that the susceptibility pattern in sputum may not be completely representative of all the bacillary populations present at the site of disease. This is an important consideration in patient failing to respond to MDR/XDR-TB treatment. Whether modification of the drug regimen or surgical removal of the lung cavity leads to better clinical outcomes in these cases is open to question.  </p>\n<br><img src=\"imagesBIO/imgBlog9B.png\">\r<p><b><i>Figure 2 - </b></i>The bottom diagram shows the situation under treatment with a combination of drugs (drugs C + D + E): drugs D & E cannot penetrate into the lung cavity whereas drug C can. There is therefore effectively monotherapy within the lung cavity with drug C and this drug pressure enables the selective growth of bacilli resistant to drugs A & B & C, which then becomes the dominant population.</p>\n\r<p><b><i>References</b></i></p>\r<p><a href=\"http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/6/e51.full\">Kempker RR, Rabin AS, Nikolaishvili K, et al.

(10, NULL, '<p>Bedaquiline (TMC-207), a diarylquinolone, is an anti-TB drug based on a novel mode of action (inhibition of ATP synthase). Initial results from a phase 2 randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial were reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2009. A new article published ahead of print in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy provides longer term follow-up data on efficacy and safety up to 104 weeks. </p>\r', '<p>This was a multicentre trial within South Africa, enrolling individuals with pulmonary MDR-TB, most of whom were HIV negative (87%). All were treated with an individualised background drug regimen consisting at least of kanamycin, ethionamide, ofloxacin (all except one patient), in combination with other selected second-line TB drugs. Patients were randomised to the inclusion of bedaquiline or placebo in the regimen, administered only for the first eight weeks of therapy. Participants then continued on the background regimen and were followed up for two years (104 weeks).</p>\r<p>In total 47 patients were included in the trial (23 treated with bedaquiline, 24 with placebo). Two patients with XDR-TB at baseline were excluded from the efficacy analysis as was one patient with negative pre-treatment culture. </p>\r<p>The key findings were:</p>\r<p><b> - Time to 50% sputum conversion was 78 days in the bedaquiline arm vs 129 days in the placebo arm</p>\r<p> - At 24 weeks, 81.0% in the bedaquiline arm had culture conversion vs 65.2% in the placebo arm</p>\r<p> - Treatment success at 104 weeks was not substantially different between the two groups (52.4% for bedaquiline vs 47.8% for placebo). The precise definition of this outcome is not stated in the paper but it is presumed to represent standard WHO definitions, i.e. cure or completion</b></p>\r<p>Rates of discontinuation in the study were very high, with 49% of all study subjects discontinuing, over half of those within the first 24 weeks. It should be noted that many of these were discontinuation from study follow-up rather than necessarily discontinuation of treatment and that many study subjects were culture negative at the time of discontinuation.</p>\r<p>There was evidence that the accumulation of additional drug resistance was more frequent in the placebo arm (6 patients developed additional resistance vs one subject in the bedaquiline arm). Of particular concern was the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in four patients in the placebo arm. </p>\r<p>In the safety analysis, there was excess nausea in the bedaquiline arm (26.1% vs nil) but no other significant difference between the two arms. This is of concern given that nausea is a symptom that might affect adherence to therapy, especially outside the trial setting with less rigorous monitoring and follow-up. Having said that it is surprising that no nausea was reported in the placebo arm given the drug regimens used in this group and the frequency of this symptom in routine practice. It will be important to assess the frequency, severity, and effect on adherence of nausea in the continuing trials of bedaquiline.</p>\r<p>The second stage of the phase 2 trial (an open label trial comparing 24 weeks of bedaquiline vs placebo in combination with a background regimen for MDR-TB patients) has now completed recruitment and the results are awaited with much interest. It is expected that regulatory approval will be sought on the basis of these results. Furthermore, a phase 3 trial is planned, evaluating the use of bedaquiline as part of a 9-month treatment regimen for MDR-TB. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p><b><i>References</b></i></p>\r<p>Diacon AH, Pym A, Grobusch M, et al.

(11, NULL, '<p>Over the past two decades Africa has experienced a sharp increase in the mortality rate due to dreadful diseases that have plagued the continent, such as Hepatitis B, Tuberculosis (TB), HIV/Aids, and Malaria, to name a few, some curable and most of which un-curable. This spread of diseases is heavily felt in this third world continent (Africa) and unfortunately a continent where there are less and less solid structures in place to control the spread. South Africa is a prime example of how burdensome this increase has been. </p>', '<p>Adding fuel to the fire in South Africa is the lack of human resource in the Health care system, particularly doctors; with or without field experience. South Africa alone has a significant gap in ratio of doctors to patients of 77: 100 000. This lack of or in adequacy thereof is exacerbated in rural hospitals and rural clinics. <b><i>\'It is largely just that doctors prefer to work in more developed, urban settings than in the rural areas so it is difficult to retain medical doctors in the rural areas after their community service\'</b></i> commented Dr Richard Lessells, a Clinical Research fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who is based at the Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies, an infectious diseases specialist and one of the few doctors working in the treatment of TB/HIV at the Hlabisa sub-district in KwaZulu Natal; this sub district with a population size of 220 000 has a high burden of unemployment and a high prevalence of HIV and TB, and most recently noted a high level of prevalence in HIV drug resistance. He added on to say <b><i>\'Whilst there have been some initiatives and incentives to retain doctors in rural areas, this has not been enough and South Africa is still not training enough doctors to cope with the burden of disease in the country\'</b></i>.</p>\r<p>Fairly speaking, this shortage does not only apply to doctors, but also to all healthcare professionals in general (doctors, nurses, etc) <b><i>\'nurses are forced to take on expanded roles without receiving appropriate training or supervision, and patients often not get seen by a doctor in circumstances where that level of expertise is required\'</b></i>, says Dr. Lessells. The victim in this whole shortage scenario is not the patient, as one would feel but the whole health care system. The high burden also puts a strain on doctors who are present which can lead to burn out? thus perpetuating a vicious cycle where doctors do not want to stay and thus the shortage continues and puts strain on the next group of doctors. <b><i>\'This causes high attrition rates, the inability to attract and retain staff in the public sector, which results in chronic understaffing\'</b></i> added Dr. Cloete van Vuuren, a physician and an HIV specialist working at the University of the Free State. According to Dr. van Vuuren, the implication of this to the patient is long queues and waiting times. </p>\r<p>Most of the articles published concerning this topic have focused on exposing how little government is doing to limit the shortage of doctors, however this blog do not want to do this as we have experienced (in the past 13 years working in South Africa) that the government has been trying very hard and achieving very good results on the expantion of HIV and TB treatment. Although longitudinally these articles tackle important points that have to be looked in to, however they fail to look at current state of the country and what is or not possible during this HIV/TB national emergency. Looking at the threat of TB/HIV drug resistance, and with limited doctors with or without experience in infectious diseases, one approach would be to look at this in a South African context, if not Africa as a whole; at the moment the closest person to the patient in clinical care is a nurse, and in one way or the other a patient will meet or be in contact with in a nurse in any/every clinic visit. If there is not a good supply of doctors, then they will be no choice but to use nurses to treat complex illnesses, to have confidence in implementing this approach the focus should also be on equipping and capacitating nurses to handle complex clinical cases. <b><i>\'We need to limit unnecessary expenditure, create an environment where people feel valued (resources for junior staff to attend conferences and courses), senior support at all levels for junior doctors etc\'</b></i> (Dr Cloete van Vuuren).   </p>\r<p>Dr. Lessells added on to say <b><i>\'We need to rapidly capacitate the health system to be able to manage drug-resistant HIV and TB cases, as specialist physicians will not be accessible to all patients. This means educating doctors, nurses, and allied health workers in drug resistance and cascading that knowledge through the health system. It also means a key role for surveillance and research so that we develop evidence-based treatment policies and work out the best way to implement these in the real world\'</b></i>. </p>\r<p>In conclusion, it is easy to pin point loopholes in the system, and not provide substantial solutions or suggestions to fill in the loopholes. While the South African heath ministry continuously strive to find better treatment of quality for all to treat its patients, it can never overlook the fact that the health care system itself needs to be treated, so in essence treat the health care system in order to treat patients. Recently, Dr. Tulio de Oliveira has been participating in discussions with the government (e.g. HIV and TB Research Summit) and believes that the public health system is advancing and that we are likely to see much better results in the near future!</p>\r', 'Lungani Ndwandwe, Tulio de Oliveira', 'imgBlog11.png', NULL, 'Shortage of doctors in rural South Africa?', '2012-03-29', 'imgBlog11sm.png', 'Shortage, medical, physicians, rural, south africa, kwazulu-natal, Africa', 'Shortage of doctors in rural South Africa?

Africa Centre is an international HIV research facility with a partnership HIV testing, treatment and care programme run jointly with the KZN Department of Health. It is based in rural, northern KwaZulu-Natal where the HIV epidemic is one of the most severe in the world with nearly 1 in 2 adults aged 35-40 being infected. This project aims to foster community discussion about scientific research and to bring evidence based HIV health promoting messages to everyday spaces such as public transportation, leisure spaces and shopping precincts. It involves developing, distributing and evaluating 3 CDs over 2 years. Each CD contains a radio-style information interview, interspersed with popular music, targeted HIV health promotion messages and calls to action.</p>', '<p>Two of the three CDs are now complete, and are being distributed free-of charge to key stakeholders in the local community including taxi drivers, shebeen owners and hair salon operators. Taxis are the main mode of transport in the Africa Centre research area with almost two thirds of the population (an estimated 50 to 60 thousand people) using a taxi on a weekly basis. Each one has a CD player, although most operators only have a couple of CDs to play. Thus, the primary target audience in this initiative is the users of local mini-bus taxis. On the 13th of February 2011 the project launch was held at the Mtubatuba Taxi Association. The event was well-attended with close to 200 taxi drivers present. At the launch drivers received two CDs together with an HIV fact sheet, a \'Jiving with science\' T-shirt and a meal. Once Africa Centre has received feedback from the drivers on commuter responses to these first two CDs, a third disc will be designed and distributed.</p>\r<p>This is a really exciting project because we anticipate that these informative CDs will improve the public understanding of HIV transmission and prevention strategies. Furthermore, through this project Africa Centre has engaged new sectors in the community who are now actively participating in its research and effort to prevent HIV transmission.  These partnerships are essential to the success of the project. For example, without the engagement and active participation of the taxi drivers, and the local taxi associations, these CDs will not be heard by the public. This project has also allowed Africa Centre to engage partners in the music industry who, in line with social responsibility agendas, have waivered the production rights on selected popular music tracks. In exchange Africa Centre has provided them with an opportunity to advertise and have their music heard in this often-inaccessible rural setting.  This is the first time that such a partnership has been developed in this area and we will use this project to gain a more sophisticated understanding of whether and how science communication and the needs of industry can work alongside each other in this context.</p>\r<p>To date, the support received from the music industry has been great. For example, DJ Tira, who is the owner of the famous Afrotainment studios and is originally from Hlabisa, has taken a special interest in this project. DJ Tira has donated 6 Afrotainment songs and also plays the part of the main actor in the dialogue. <b><i>We would like to say a big \'thank you\' to DJ Tira for his generosity and support. Another important contributor is Malcom Nhleko of Maltre Productions, who kindly recorded the CD dialogue at his studio in Newlands West. Other partners in the music industry who have provided the project with songs include Sheer Sound, EMI, Gallo, Abafana Bokuthula and Debrah Gumede.

What highlights this plan among others is the fact that the DoH has adopted it as a plan of action that will treat the epidemics as a state of emergency; the plan includes putting measures in place for everyone to know their HIV status and also have everyone screened for TB.</p>\r<p>The integration of TB, HIV and STIs is also a very interesting point of the current NSP. This should bring health workers and health professionals to integrate TB and HIV diagnosis and treatment at primary health care. This will ultimately ensure that TB patients who are also infected with HIV are initiated early for ART despite their CD4 count. This will hopefully reduce the number of preventable deaths and will also help to fight the stigma associated with people living with HIV and TB.</p>\r<p>The DoH has invited, in April 2012, many of the top researchers and public health officials to a summit in Johannesburg in order to discuss research priorities for HIV & TB as part of the current NSP. This was a very interesting meeting which SATuRN was present at it. In this meeting, reseach priorities for the next five years were identified and ranked. HIV & TB drug resistance ranked high in the priority list. </p>\r<p>The DoH has called on all sectors of society, organisations and individuals to collaborate in the implementation of this strategic plan. SATuRN supports this initiative and is already in talks with the department to find better solutions to the growing threat of HIV drug resistance. One of the major objectives outlined by the NSP is sustaining the health and wellness of patients on ART. </p>\r<p>SATuRN strongly believes that HIV drug failure is an emergency which has dire consequences on the well being of the patients and also to the patients clinical management. HIV drug resistance may soon undermine the success of the scale-up of ARVs by the DoH, in that way SATuRN will continue making efforts to collaborate and work together with academic intitutions, funders and government in curbing this threat.</p>\r<p>The Department does not only set the agenda, but has adopted a bottom-up approach which opens new grounds for participation by communities and private organisations.

Below are a few of the highlights of my experience at AIDS2012.</p>', '<p>In the first plenary of the meeting, Anthony Fauci announced that the scientific knowledge now exists for us to envisage an HIV-free generation for the first time in the 3 decades since HIV was first described.  Breakthroughs in the field have been incremental over the years and include knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms of HIV, understanding the early events following infection particularly at the mucosal surfaces, understanding the replication cycle and targets for interventions during this cycle. A key factor is not that we do not have the knowledge but that we implement what we know appropriately.  This theme was reiterated throughout the meeting.  Given the global economic downturn, several key speakers pointed out the need for resource-poor countries to reduce their complete dependency on funders, seek alternative and innovative funding strategies and ensure the sustainability of existing and future treatment and management programs.</p>\n<p>Of interest to the social scientists at the centre would have been a talk by Phil Wilson, an HIV positive gay man who highlighted the worrying epidemic among Black women in the US where approximately 44% of their epidemic is concentrated in only 12 states with the highest rates in the DC area.  His talk proposed that in order to end the epidemic biomedical as well as behavioral interventions must be fully integrated.  I also met the co-founder of the LIVE Consortium a US group that targets high risk groups including college and high school students for their education and behavioral interventions particularly in the Black communities.  The knowledge of HIV he maintains is sorely lacking and there remains significant stigma attached to the disease which I found surprising considering the US\'s first world status and their interventions in other countries of the world.</p>\n<p>It was a great privilege to hear the dynamic and eloquent US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speak.  Her announcement of additional funding for HIV/AIDS research and interventions was welcomed.  The message that a multi-factorial approach is essential to eradicate the epidemic appears to have reached the funders as the US now pledged funds to address VTC, TasP, voluntary male circumcision, pMTCT.</p>\n<p>Anthony Harries gave an account of HIV/TB co-infection in his plenary and highlighted implementation of integrated HIV/TB programs that include the Isoniazid preventative treatment (IPT) and the Test and Treat strategies to reduce the HIV/TB burden worldwide.  He emphasised that in high-burden countries such as ours, parallel ART and TB treatment programs are wholly inadequate to disease prevention or management.  Instead, an integrated program aligned to social, behavioural and educational strategies nested within strong management programs would certainly stem the growing HIV/TB co-infection epidemic. </p>\n<p>Overall, there was much excitement regarding the amended WHO pMTCT guidelines to include Option B+ but a few voices of reason cautioned that implementation without proper research and infrastructure in place is a recipe for disaster.  After listening to the various arguments for and against the large-scale roll-out of Option B+, I wonder if we should perhaps amend the last statement in our Breast Milk paper to suggest B+ only if it is supported by the appropriate infrastructure, management programme and community support.  I had the pleasure of chatting with Prof Jerry Coovadia regarding the current and revised WHO pMTCT guidelines.  He found it of great concern that the B+ strategy was proposed without an investigation of the short and long term outcomes in women initiated on ART according to the B+ criteria and was eager to pursue a study, with Africa Centre, on the impact of Option B+ on pMTCT success.</p>\n<p>My poster was also well received with several useful comments and suggestions on future work.  I think it may be of interest to expand the current study of post-natal transmitters to include a study of the viral evolution in peri-natal transmitters to determine whether the timing of the introduction into the breast compartment, among other factors, may account for the timing of transmission (peri, versus- post natal) to the infant.  Interestingly, one of the basic scientists to visit my poster was Dr S. Tugizov from UCSF who has a similar interest in MTCT but his focus is the gut mucosa. </p>\n<p>Also interesting was the new findings regarding HIV, aging and congenital disease.  Again, the Africa Centre was mentioned in this talk.  In a growing number of countries, HIV is being managed as a chronic illness with related chronic disorders such as heart disease, osteoporosis and neurological disorders.  Evidence of accelerated aging in HIV positive patients was also presented. </p>\n', 'Siva Danaviah', 'imgBlog16.jpg', NULL, 'AIDS XIX 2012 conference: impressions of a South African researcher', '2012-09-12', 'imgBlog16sm.jpg', 'AIDS, 2012, conference, blog, Siva Danaviah, perspective, south Africa, scientist, researcher, presenter, pmtct, drug resistance, HIV, TB\n', 'As a summary of my activities during the meeting, I was able to attend several interesting sessions regarding mother to child transmission, viral latency and of course the viral resistance and an excellent talk on HIV/TB co-infection.

One thing that one readily picked up on the day of the visit, of which is one of the benefits of home-based care is that the sick are surrounded by people they love and are familiar with, which makes the level of care flexible and at times stretched.  Patients in this type of care are often very sick and in this rural setting suffer from financial constraints. In this visit we met a woman who had been bedbound for a year; she was paralyzed after a complicated child birth procedure. She cannot move or take care of herself and relies heavily on the assistance from caregivers and family members. Fortunately her now one year old baby boy survived the procedure. Her biggest worry is that she cannot hold, feed, and take care of her baby as his mother. As mentioned above financial constraints have impacted negatively on the situation; the patient has to regularly go to the clinic to take bloods and this often requires her to hire transport to get to the clinic. As there are limited resources at the local clinic, the clinic can offer ambulance transport only in life threatening emergencies. This is one of many examples home-based care givers find themselves in, and on a day to day basis they see 2 to 3 patients with similar cases. </p>\n<p>Zooming out and looking at a bigger picture of the entire health system in South Africa, particularly in rural communities a lot has been achieved by the National Department of Health (NDoH) in training and employing home-based care givers. The NDoH is looking into installing a primary health home-based outreach team of volunteers in rural communities. This team of volunteers who will be accompanied by a trained nurse will visit patient\'s homes and take bloods where necessary. This great initiative will see to it that patients who cannot get to the clinic because of reasons relating to the shortage of money and being bedbound receive good, supervised treatment from the comfort of their beds.</p>\n<p>We would like to thank Dr. Kevi Naidu and Sister Dana Chirwa from the Africa Centre\'s ART program for making provisions for the above mentioned patient to be seen by a nurse and also for making provisions for her to take bloods.

Understandably there was disappointment that the vaccine strategy explored in the trial failed to show any protective effect. However, there was also optimism not only about the lessons that could be learnt from the trial results but also around the fact that a large-scale vaccine trial had been conducted effectively in South Africa, at the epicentre of the global TB epidemic. </p>\n<p>The need for a new TB vaccine in high-burden settings is obvious and has been re-emphasised by this trial, demonstrating a substantial force of infection where one in eight of the young children in the study was infected with TB over the two years of follow-up. The vaccine under investigation in this trial was the MVA85A vaccine, which incorporates a highly attenuated strain of Vaccinia virus expressing the M. tuberculosis antigen 85A. Phase I studies had demonstrated that the vaccine induced high levels of antigen-specific IFN-gamma-secreting T cells in adults and infants. </p>\n<p>This phase IIb trial recruited healthy HIV-uninfected infants (4-6 months old) previously vaccinated with BCG and without evidence of TB infection (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube negative) from a rural community in the Western Cape. A total of 2797 infants were randomised to receive either the MVA85A vaccine or placebo and were then followed up for an average of two years. In terms of safety, there were no serious adverse events that were considered vaccine-related but local adverse events at the injection site were reported for almost all vaccine recipients (although there is quite limited information about these in the paper). It was demonstrated that vaccine induced an antigen-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte response but this was less marked than that reported for adults. </p>\n<p>Using TB disease as an endpoint in vaccine studies is complicated by the difficulties faced in accurately diagnosing active TB disease in young children (perhaps highlighted by the fact that 13% of the children across both arms were placed on treatment for active TB disease during the course of the study). The researchers here used carefully-constructed definitions for TB disease as the primary efficacy endpoint. During follow-up, 32/1399 (2.3%) in the vaccine group and 39/1395 (2.8%) in the placebo group developed TB disease, providing no evidence of a difference between vaccine and placebo. The secondary efficacy outcome of TB infection (based on QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube conversion) was reached in 178/1399 (12.7%) of vaccine recipients and 171/1395 (12.3%) in the placebo group, providing no evidence of protection from TB infection. </p>\n<p>There is discussion, both in the article itself and in the accompanying editorial, about why the vaccine may not have shown any protective efficacy. There is likely to be much additional work with the data and the samples collected for this study to give further insight into the lack of efficacy and to inform future studies. The vaccine has shown immunogenicity in HIV-infected adults and the efficacy for the prevention of TB disease is currently being investigated in another phase II trial with HIV-infected adults in South Africa and Senegal.

This was particularly so in South Africa, where efforts to control multidrug-resistant TB (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) have been characterised by poor treatment outcomes. Now researchers from Stellenbosch University have used molecular techniques to provide strong evidence not only that such strains can been detected in the Eastern Cape Province but also that transmission of these strains has been occurring.</p>\n<p>The study by Marisa Klopper and colleagues, published in Emerging Infectious Diseases, reports analysis of 651 M. tuberculosis strains isolated from sputum cultures between July 2008 and July 2009 at the main provincial TB laboratory. Of the 342 strains that were resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid (MDR-TB) on routine testing, molecular analysis showed that 60% had pre-XDR-TB or XDR-TB (i.e. mutations conferring resistance to either or both a second-line injectable and fluoroquinolone). Increasing drug resistance was associated with one particular genotype of M. tuberculosis (atypical Beijing strain). Moreover, molecular analysis showed that the pre-XDR-TB and XDR-TB isolates were genetically very closely related, providing reasonable evidence that there had been transmission of these resistant strains (and that they had not all emerged independently in people exposed to second-line drugs). It was noteworthy that these strains were found in several districts within the province, rather than being clustered in one geographic area. The study was purely a laboratory-based study and there was no linkage to individual clinical information which to some extent limits interpretation of the data.</p>\n<p>Of the 103 atypical Beijing XDR-TB strains, the vast majority (95%) had evidence on genotypic testing of resistance to all the drugs tested: isoniazid (katG and inhA gene), rifampicin (rpoB), ethambutol (embB), pyrazinamide (pncA), streptomycin (rrs500), amikacin (rrs1400), kanamycin (rrs1400), capreomycin (rrs1400), ethionamide (inhA) and ofloxacin (gyrA). It should be noted, however, that there was poor correlation between the presence of genetic mutations and phenotypic drug susceptibility for ethambutol, ethionamide and capreomycin. Only a sub-sample was tested for susceptibility to p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) using phenotypic methods and, of those, 20% were defined as resistant. No genotypic or phenotypic test was performed for cycloserine/terizidone. </p>\n<p>In a separate study from KwaZulu-Natal, also published in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Max O\'Donnell and colleagues present outcomes for 114 adults treated for XDR-TB at the provincial drug-resistant TB referral hospital in KwaZulu-Natal. All cases started treatment between December 2006 and October 2007 and outcomes were ascertained from routine hospital records. Most were treated with a standardised regimen consisting of capreomycin, pyrazinamide, PAS, ethionamide, ethambutol and cycloserine or terizidone. There was no laboratory data regarding drug susceptibility over and above the routine diagnostic tests used to identify the XDR-TB. Only around one in five cases (22%) had a successful outcome (cure or completion) - 42% died, 17% defaulted and 19% failed treatment. Of the 42 cases with culture conversion during treatment, one in six showed culture reversion, suggesting the emergence of additional resistance during treatment. </p>\n<p>The data provided in these two papers highlight the challenges faced in the response to drug-resistant TB in South Africa. Improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to address this problem. There is now a substantial body of evidence demonstrating poor outcomes with standardised drug regimens for MDR- and XDR-TB. The development of molecular tests that can detect the genetic mutations associated with resistance to second-line drugs offers the opportunity for more rapid detection of specific resistance patterns and might allow individually tailored regimens, but whether or not this leads to better outcomes need to be explored in rigorous studies. Collection and curation of genetic data might allow identification of individual marker mutations that are associated with particular patterns of drug resistance - this was seen with the Eastern Cape isolates (and previous research by the same group) where the presence of mutations in the inhA promoter region was associated with pre-XDR- and XDR-TB. Even with advances in diagnostics, however, there is a pressing need for new anti-TB drugs and regimens to offer a realistic hope of improved outcomes. Whilst there are new drugs undergoing clinical trials, the global TB community is pushing for accelerated evaluation and approval. These results from South Africa show us exactly why people cannot wait. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><i>Sources</b></i></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/3/12-0246_article.htm\">Klopper M, Warren RM, Hayes C, van Pittius CG, Streicher EM, Muller B, Sirgel FA, Chabula-Nxiweni M, Hoosain E, Coetzee G, van Helden PD, Victor TC, Trollip AP.

A functional cure is different from a complete cure in that while the virus is not eliminated, it is kept under control in the absence of therapy and does not impact on patient well-being.</p>', '<p>In this case, the mother was diagnosed with HIV in labour. At the time, her viral load was very low (2423 copies/ml) and CD4 count was high (644 cells/ml), suggesting a low viral inoculum to the baby. The child was initiated on an AZT/3TC/NVP (NVP at full dose, without the 2 week \'lead-in\') regimen on second day of life following 2 separate positive HIV DNA and RNA tests (VL 19,812copies/ml). Three additional viral loads at day 7, 12 and 20 were positive. LPV/r was substituted for NVP from day 7 until discontinuation of therapy by the caregiver at 18 months. When the infant returned to care 8 months later, the HIV RNA was undetectable and remained so (<20 copies/ml) on 16 different measurements between 1 - 26 months despite discontinuation of treatment, and CD4% levels remained normal throughout. Using standard clinical assays, plasma viral load, PBMC DNA, and HIV-specific antibodies remained undetected following return to care. Using ultrasensitive methods, a single copy of HIV RNA was detected in plasma and 37 copies HIV DNA/million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were detected at age 24 months. At age 26 months HIV DNA was detected at 4 copies/million PBMC but with no 2-LTR circles. Follow-up of the child will continue to see if virus is once again detected in the child\'s blood. </p>\n<p>Similar reports of functional cures have been reported following cessation of therapy in adults identified shortly after infection. Whilst these cases provide exciting insights into mechanisms of viral control, they remain isolated incidents and should not be regarded as the norm. At this stage, early initiation of ART should not be a reason to discontinue ART without expert consultation and outside of a structured trial. It is essential that pregnant women receive appropriate ART for pMTCT.</p>\n<p>Further investigations and studies are critical to establish if aggressive and early treatment with ART may hold the key to functional cure (Saez-Cirion et al, PLoS Pathog 9(3): e1003211) and whether this can be translated into a treatment strategy. The case of the Mississippi baby, however, makes a compelling case for undertaking a diagnostic PCR in babies on day one of life or as soon as possible where pMTCT has been sub-optimal or non-existent, as in utero transmission (which is linked to rapid disease progression and death in young infants) is possible (Lillian et al, J Clin Microbiol 2012; 50: 2373-7).

For example, researchers in South Africa were among the ones to prove that antiretroviral therapy can prevent infection. The first piece of evidence was in the ground breaking HTPN052 trial that showed a decrease of 96% of infection in negative partners if the positive one received treatment (ref. 1). Recently, Africa Centre\'s researchers have shown a decrease in 40% of incidence at population level with the increased coverage of Antiretroviral (ART) (ref. 2). In addition, in 2010, Science listed the results from CAPRISA Tenofovir gel as one of the 10 most important scientific discoveries of the year (ref 3). On the basic science, recent results from Prof. Lynn Morris\'s group have identified very potent antibodies that may guide new vacinnes (ref 4).

Perhaps unsurprisingly, these patients were less likely to achieve viral suppression once switched to second-line ART.  Furthermore, resistance to NRTIs did not increase risk of first-line failure.  In fact, overall patients with resistance did better, perhaps because it reflected a higher degree of adherence.  These findings suggest that efforts to intensify adherence support when switching regimens are often unsuccessful and lead to sub-optimal second-line outcomes. </p>\n<p>Sub-therapeutic drug concentrations also influenced the patterns of resistance mutations observed at switch; NRTI mutations were detected in 97% of patients on \'therapeutic\' first-line ART, compared to 31% on a \'sub-therapeutic\' regimen.

These findings underline the need to develop simple point-of-care tools for reliably identifying patients in whom non-adherence continues to contribute to viraemia, including options such as simple bio-assays for therapeutic drug levels or other robust measures of adherence.

The assay included 20 wild-type alleles and 25 mutant alleles, to give a total of 45 primers for the assay. </p>\n', '<p>The primer design was based on HIV-1 Subtype C, but modifications for non-C subtypes are currently being investigated. This new method has significant implications in the Southern African context since it allows for the simultaneous detection of several resistance mutations for HIV-1 subtype C, which is predominant in this region. MAS assay can potentially reduce the costs associated with other resistance testing methods like population sequencing since equipment for suspension array technology is cheaper. Detection of mutations using MAS assay can be accomplished in a shorter time, making this method more time-efficient. </p>\n<p>The simultaneous detection of several resistance mutations within the protease and reverse transcriptase genes with MAS assay has an advantage over current allele-specific PCR methods, in which assays are tailored to single mutation sites. MAS assay allows for the addition or removal of primers for particular known mutation sites when they need to be included or excluded in the assay. When compared to population-based sequencing which detects virus mutations in abundance of 20%, this assay can detect low-frequency mutations with a sensitivity of up to 1.6% for some mutations. The results of low-frequency mutations detected by MAS in plasma samples were confirmed by 454 sequencing. </p>\n<p>This assay presents a methodology that is quick and easy to interpret. Therefore, it can be used in resource limited settings for surveillance and monitoring of transmitted or acquired HIV-1 drug resistance in countries where subtype C virus predominates. Mutations like K103N/R, Y181C and M184V are commonly described in South Africa for subtype C viruses, therefore this assay may prove to be useful for surveillance of these and other mutations. However, this assay cannot be used to detect new drug resistance mutations (unknown mutations) and may not be suitable for clinical diagnostics in patient management.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><i>Blog by: Anna Salimo</b></i>, Medical Scientist, Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute of Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa.</p><br>\n<p><b><i>Manuscript title:</b></i> Simultaneous detection of major drug resistance mutations in the protease and reverse transcriptase genes for HIV-1 Subtype C using a multiplex allele-specific (MAS) assay.</p>\n<p><b><i>Authors:</b></i> Zhang G, Cai F, Zhou Z, DeVos J, Wagar N, Diallo K, Zulu I, Wadonda-Kabondo N, Stringer JSA, Weidle PJ, Ndongmo CB, Sikazwe I, Sarr A, Kagoli M, Nkengasong J, Gao F and Yang Chunfu.</p>\n<p><b><i>Journal:</b></i> Journal of Clin Micro 28 August 2013, published online ahead of print.</p>\n<p><b><i>Link:</b></i><a href=\"http://jcm.asm.org/content/early/2013/08/23/JCM.01669-13.abstract\">http://jcm.asm.org/content/early/2013/08/23/JCM.01669-13.abstract</a></p>', 'Anna Salimo', 'imgBlog30Big.png', NULL, 'Simultaneous detection of major HIV-1 drug resistance mutations using a multiplex allele-specific assay', '2013-09-25', 'imgBlog30.png', 'Anna, Salimo, HIV, MAS, allele specific, PCR, subtype C, blog, NICD, South Africa, drug resistance, mutations, Anna, Salimo, HIV, MAS, allele specific, PCR, subtype C, blog, NICD, South Africa, drug resistance, mutations,Anna, Salimo, HIV, MAS, allele specific, PCR, subtype C, blog, NICD, South Africa, drug resistance, mutations,Anna, Salimo, HIV, MAS, allele specific, PCR, subtype C, blog, NICD, South Africa, drug resistance, mutations', 'A team of authors have described a method for multiplex allele-specific assay (MAS) for HIV-1 drug resistance mutations.

Resistance to protease inhibitors occurs through mutations in the protease gene; however, many patients who fail protease inhibitor-based therapy do so without mutations in protease.

Contribution of the inhibitory effect of protease inhibitors on each step of the viral life cycle.</i></p><p>To understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the high antiviral activity of protease inhibitors, a group of researchers from John\'s Hopkins University experimentally tested each relevant step of the life cycle and measured the dose-response curves of three protease inhibitors (atazanavir, darunavir and lopinavir). Here they found that protease inhibitors do not affect the process of budding, but they do inhibit entry, reverse transcription and post-reverse transcription steps. Inhibition at the entry step was the most prominent thereby demonstrating the importance of entry inhibition in the overall effect of protease inhibitors. The researchers then cloned full-length envelope genes from patients who failed protease inhibitor-based therapy with no resistance associated mutations in protease. Pseudoviruses generated using these envelope genes cloned into a wild type backbone showed significant protease inhibitor resistance. </p>\n<p>In summary, by experimentally testing each relevant step of the viral life cycle, this study provided a mechanistic explanation for the exceptional efficacy of protease inhibitors. It also identified the envelope gene as a possible site of protease inhibitor resistance which suggests an additional mechanism for protease inhibitor failure. Commercially available phenotypic assays do not detect the change in inhibition of entry because it uses pseudoviruses with MLV-E instead of HIV-1 envelope. Currently, patient-specific changes in the envelope gene are not considered in standard genotypic or phenotypic resistance assays. </p>\n<p><b><i>Blog by Jennifer Giandhari</b></i>, PhD student, HIV Virology, Centre for HIV and STIs, National Institute of Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa.</p> \n<p><b><i>Manuscript title:</b></i> Multi-step inhibition explains HIV-1 protease inhibitor pharmacodynamics and resistance</p>\n<p><b><i>Authors:</b></i> S.

To discuss potential responses to this concern, the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development (AIGHD) and the Pan-African Studies to Evaluate Resistance (PASER) network convened a closed policy meeting in Lusaka, Zambia on 6 May 2014. </p>\n<p>The Policy Meeting\'s main objective was to bring together national policy makers, health professionals, public health experts, and medical researchers. Cross-discipline interactions created the opportunity for enhanced information exchange and mutual learning about the specific policy challenges posed by emerging HIV drug resistance in the southern African region. Among the 31 participants were representatives of Ministries of Health (South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe), the World Health Organization (WHO), communities living with HIV in Zambia, and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. They were joined by the laboratory experts, clinicians, researchers, and the coordinator of the Southern African Development Community regional HIV/AIDS Programme.</p>', '<p>Two panel discussions, moderated by Dr. Moses Kamya (Professor of Medicine, Makerere University, Uganda) and Dr. Catherine Hankins (Deputy Director Science, Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development), saw lively exchanges. Countries reported good progress in the development of strategic national plans for preventing HIV drug resistance prevention within their national HIV programs. These will contribute to enhancing awareness of HIV drug resistance and early detection, while informing the deployment of preventive measures. </p>\n<p>Although Zimbabwe, Zambia, and South Africa have conducted surveys on acquired and transmitted HIV drug resistance recently, these have not yet been repeated and time trends are lacking. Such surveys provide information that is critical to maintaining effective antiretroviral drug regimens and can be pivotal in influencing policy. For instance, Zimbabwe\'s paediatric HIV drug resistance survey found high levels of resistance associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), leading to a change in the treatment guidelines. Protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy is recommended for treatment initiation before the age of 3 yrs.  WHO-recommended Early Warning Indicators (EWIs) for HIV drug resistance are routinely collected in many sites across Zambia and Zimbabwe, where drug stockouts remain a major challenge. EWIs include a timely feedback mechanism to individual sites so that action can be taken locally on programmatic deficiencies. </p>\n<p>WHO has launched updated guidelines on HIV drug resistance prevention that include an important shift in assessment strategies from a sentinel approach to nationally representative surveys. Country representatives at the policy meeting viewed this new approach as not only feasible but also likely to generate more useful information at national level. </p>\n<p>South Africa is implementing, in collaboration with SATuRN, a central HIV drug resistance database to curate, store and summarize data, including a dashboard to present data on drug resistance mutation patterns by region. Initially, the focus will be on the public sector, with the intention to expand to include private sector data. It is the first country in the region to implement routine viral genotyping for patients who experience therapy failure on their second-line regimen. A central panel of 4 expert clinicians assesses all cases being considered for third-line therapy. Educational efforts are needed to address an important knowledge gap among clinicians concerning when to request HIV drug resistance testing, how to interpret the results, and how to best use 2nd and 3rd line regimens. Current WHO guidelines make no explicit recommendation about the use of viral genotyping to guide antiretroviral drug switching for people who are failing second-line therapy. Discussions on this topic and the issue of optimized use of the dual nucleoside backbone are needed to inform changes in the WHO guidelines.</p>\n<p>To date, few laboratories in the region have been accredited by WHO to perform HIV drug resistance testing. Some are moving forward to develop more affordable diagnostic technologies, such as those on dried blood spots. The KEMRI-CDC laboratory in Kisumu is the first to have developed their in-house resistance test into a lab kit that can be purchased commercially. Zambia will begin HIV drug resistance testing at its University Teaching Hospital and Centre for Infectious Disease Research Zambia in the coming months. Zimbabwe and Swaziland do not have in-country laboratory capacity for HIV drug resistance genotyping, but they can make arrangements with existing reference laboratories in the region. </p>\n<p>Enhanced interaction between policy, science, and clinical practice is crucial, but creating fertile conditions for it appears challenging. Funding agencies can play a role by advocating for reciprocal interactions through diplomatic channels and can stimulate researchers to conduct effective knowledge translation by disseminating their results and the implications of their findings for public health and policy. </p>\n<p>As the community representative of the National Treatment Preparedness Coalition and TALC, Zambia highlighted, there is a lot of confusion, misunderstanding, and superstition about \'acquired\' and \'transmitted\' resistance among the general public and a very real need for investment in educating the general public about HIV drug resistance. Enhanced and concerted advocacy efforts, such as those successfully conducted to bring about price reductions for antiretroviral drugs, could bring down the price of diagnostics. However, as a South African clinician stated, the costs of viral load testing are still high and the benefits are not massive; priority should still be given to expanding access to HIV treatment and enhancing support for adherence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PASER is sponsored by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands through the regional HIV/AIDS programme for Southern Africa.</p>\n<p>The meeting coincided with the 8th International Workshop on HIV Treatment, Pathogenesis, and Prevention Research in Resource-poor Settings (INTEREST).

Prof. Ziegler (Middle back) and attendants at the seminar.</i></center></p>\n<p>Ziegler started his lecture explaining that researchers cannot study a virus in a location where the conditions are not suitable for the parasite to thrive, which is why many researchers of Malaria study the virus in Africa, East Asia and South America. In a recent study conducted in Kumasi, Ghana, Prof. Ziegler and collaborators had examined 2,662 malaria cases and 2,200 controls in order to detect if there is genetic differences that predispose to the disease, the researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS). GWAS was successful to identify genetic differences in many areas, such as cardiology, gastroenterology or oncology, however, in malaria and other infectious diseases, these studies have been only partly successful.</p>\n<p>Ziegler explained that malaria genetics are quite complicated due to the 3 components: the human being, the environment and the parasite. <b><i>\'In research, we try to see what genes make a human susceptible to malaria. When it comes to malaria and drug resistance in parasites, it is important to question if there is anything in the malaria parasite or human genes that can make it resistant to malaria treatment.\'</b></i></p>\n<p><b><i>\'Malaria infection depends on the age of the patient and their location of the disease, geographically. There are high exposition levels for those of younger age. Gender wise, girls who work in households and have to fetch water have a different exposure to infectious diseases than boys. While age plays a role, there are big variability\'s. We took careful control to make sure that the cases and controls matched in ethnicity, age and gender in order to determine if there are any patterns in the contraction of the disease.\'</b></i></p>\n\n<p>Through the use of GWAS approach his research group helped to unravel relevant genetic variants that protect against malaria. Ziegler and his colleagues identified two previously unknown loci which was associated with severe falciparum malaria in patients and controls from Ghana, West Africa. <b><i>\'One of the loci was identified on chromosome 1q32 within the ATP2B4 gene, which encodes the main calcium pump of erythrocytes. The second was indicated by an intergenic single nucleotide polymorphism on chromosome 16q22.2, possibly linked to a neighbouring gene encoding the tight-junction protein MARVELD3. The findings underline the potential of the GWAS approach to provide candidates for the development of control measures against infectious diseases in humans.\'</b></i></p>\n<br>\n\n<p><b>Publication details:</b></p><p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22895189\">Timmann C, Thye T, Vens M, Evans J, May J, Ehmen C, Sievertsen J, Muntau B, Ruge G, Loag W, Ansong D, Antwi S, Asafo-Adjei E, Nguah SB, Kwakye KO, Akoto AO, Sylverken J, Brendel M, Schuldt K, Loley C, Franke A, Meyer CG, Agbenyega T, Ziegler A, Horstmann RD 2012.

(40, NULL, '<p>In a gripping, informative seminar, Dr van Zyl took the audience on a journey through a Tale of 4 Cities (Berlin, Mississipi, Cape Town, Pittsburg) in outlining researcher\'s strive towards a cure for HIV.  </p>', '<p>He began the journey in Berlin with the Berlin-patient who was apparently cured following a bone marrow transplant from an individual with the CCR5 Delta 32 mutation that appears to confer protection against HIV infection.  This patient\'s incredible recovery was hailed internationally but replicating this outcome on a larger scale is impractical given the unique nature of this patient\'s concomitant condition (leukemia) and the prohibitive cost of his treatment. Scepticism abounded among researchers but the hope of a cure based on the Delta 32 mutation persisted.  Several years of follow-up indicated that this patient remained suppressed showing no sign of viral rebound.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>His next stop was Mississippi, USA and the infant who was initiated on treatment within days of birth in 2010, tested negative and remained suppressed for 27 months, a record in terms of period an individual has remained suppressed without antiretroviral treatment.  Again, hope was rekindled and thoughts of an AIDS free generation sprouted.  Eliminating HIV in the young ensures that mother-to-child transmission of HIV will no longer be a concern, that infants born infected with the disease no longer had to be exposed to life-long antiretroviral drugs and the associated toxicities and that we, the research community, were that much closer to eliminating this scourge to human health.  Alas, it was not to be for on the next leg of this journey, Melbourne, Australia and the International AIDS conference July 2014.  The conference followed on the heels of the staggering announcement that the Mississippi baby was found to have detectable viral load and was, in fact, not cured but had rebounded.  While extremely disappointing, this child represented the hope that a cure is not inconceivable and a wealth of lessons learnt that would certainly inform future research in the field.  </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, Dr van Zyl stopped off in his hometown of Cape Town and outlined his own research where he undertook highly sensitive qPCR assays to detect HIV RNA and DNA at single copy levels.  This work was conducted in Pittsburgh, USA and was supported by a Fogarty Award that Dr van Zyl received.  His preliminary findings revealed distinct viral kinetics in infants infected in-utero or during labour, diagnosed early (within 2 months of birth) and initiated immediately on ART.  One of the primary challenges he outlined in cure research is accurately detecting low-level viremia.  Current viral detection and quantification methods are not sensitive and reliable enough to detect virus at single-copy levels, they require specialised techniques or large volumes of blood making them challenging and prohibitive on a larger scale. As in the past with the Berlin patient and the Mississippi baby, declaring a patient \'cured\' may be premature without the ability to access latently infected cells that may be sequestered within remote or impenetrable anatomical sites.  The same is true for antiretroviral treatment that may not permeate to every anatomical and cellular site of HIV infection.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While Dr van Zyl highlighted these challenges inherent to research towards a cure for HIV he was hopeful that such a panacea would be forthcoming. All is not bleak, he emphasised but we do have a ways to go before we can declare that we do indeed have a cure for HIV.  </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As part of the Africa Centre MRC Flagship seminar series held monthly in the KRITH Building, NRMSM, UKZN, Dr Gert van Zyl presented a talk titled <b><i>\'Antiretroviral therapy initiated before 2-months-of-age reduces transcriptionally active HIV-1 DNA persistence\'</b></i> on the 19th September 2014.  </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gert van Zyl (MBChB, FCPath(SA) Virology, PhD) is a South African trained medical doctor, who specialized in Virological Pathology.

Furthermore, my supervisor (Prof. Tulio) sent us to University of Western Cape (SANBI) to do intense Bioinformatics Course. This for me came at a right time because my project needed some of bioinformatics? tools.

We ended up staying in a beautiful place called Lavaux, near Lausanne. Who would have thought Switzerland would have a place full of vineyards, along the giant Lake Geneva, which is listed as a UNESCO heritage site? The Lavaux vineyard area is unique with the narrow streets, tiny villages and many traditional family wine-making businesses along the way. It seemed almost surreal that we would be treated to the absolute splendour and peace of Lake Geneva, where all types of boats and watercraft were seen on the lake, as the Swiss take to the water for their exercise and enjoyment for the day. </p>', '<p>We spent the weekend experiencing the joy of public transport, jumping on and off trains, as well as missing a few of the trains coming through the small stations. In fact, the three of us got to know the train stations very well. We managed to make our way to Geneva where we did a lot of walking around, taking selfies and sightseeing within this amazing city. We found ourselves in a tiny Swiss shop full of chocolates and all sorts of goodies and purchased a few things for our families back home. </p>\n<p>Monday came around soon enough and all three of us, now armed with the knowledge of how the trains worked, managed to miss the first train that we needed, in order to get to the University of Lausanne, it might have had something to do with Ben not being a morning person. Luckily for us, our meeting with Ioannis Xenarios; the Director of Vital-IT and Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), was about mid-morning so we jumped on the second train within the hour. We arrived on the doorstep of the Lausanne University and were introduced to Vital-IT\'s heads of department and settled into receiving a presentation from them about the structure of their scientific business. </p>\n<p>They have eight senior scientists who lead research and collaborative development projects at Vital-IT and their skills are inter-complementary with many domains of ability that involve computational sciences, algorithm development and data analysis. Vital-IT facilitates the provision of technical and scientific support, working with scientists and on research projects at the Schools of Higher Education. Vital-IT also coordinates the use of information technology and bioinformatics resources in life sciences. In particular, it supports research through integration with the genomics, proteomics and imaging core facilities in south-west Switzerland and by taking part in several SystemsX.ch and international projects. </p>\n<p>Their presentation was structured on the history of their business and how they built the business over the years using their knowledge, expertise and plenty of support from various sectors. Their key success point was to ensure the stability of harnessing all areas of expertise to utilise. They put their success down to harnessing all areas of expertise within their business as well as receiving funding from different sectors instead of relying on funding from a sole supplier. This point was very informative as it highlighted the need of working as a team in order to become successful. What their presentation emphasised was for KRISP to utilise the insight and ability from a successful group such as Vital-IT in order to become a successful model incorporating bioinformatics within the centre.</p>\n<p>It was our turn to present to their group. The presentation helped the Vital- IT team visualise our structure of KRISP and where we were with the setting up of KRISP. It also identified our weak areas within KRISP, which led to a fruitful discussion and some helpful suggestions so that the various heads could suggest solutions and options for us to discuss and ascertain if we could use those ideas. <b><i>\'One of the suggestions was to attract the right expertise to KRISP, expertise within our various fields in order to ensure we cover all services to provide the correct service to collaborators and third parties. Another useful suggestion was to ensure that we start with charging for omics data and bioinformatics analysis from the beginning as this is a costly exercise. They suggest that we should not starting by giving everything for free, as later on when you want to start charging for a service your clients and collaborators are going to want that service for free and it will be difficult, if not impossible, to have funding to retain top scientists.</b></i></p>\n<p><center><img src=\"imagesBIO/imgblog44b.png\"></a></center> </p>\n<p>On Wednesday, we packed up and left Lavaux at 3:30 am in the morning so that we could make the first flight out to Sweden and hopefully not miss any of the other flights along the way. After spending the day, running around the three different airports with our heavy luggage and not missing a single flight, we arrived in Sweden, the land of Abba and Swedish meatballs. It was our first experience of using the bus transport route only to miss our stop and end up a few kilometers down the road. Needless to say, we had to drag our heavy luggage around the town of Stockholm trying to figure out where our hotel was. </p>\n<p><center><img src=\"imagesBIO/imgblog44c.png\"></a></center> </p>\n\n<p>We were exhausted. Along the way, we bumped into a Swede who quite happily showed us the way to our hotel. En route, whilst we were chatting to him, we happened to meet Elina Staaf, the project coordinator from SciLife laboratory, who very kindly took us through to the hotel to check in. We then went for dinner to a restaurant down the road from the hotel without the luggage thank goodness!. We had a wonderful time chatting with her and finding out what the next few days were going to hold for us. We learnt that we were going to be introduced to all the heads of department at SciLife Laboratory, which is a national centre for molecular biosciences and focuses on health and environmental research. </p>\n<p>SciLife Lab is a national resource formed on a collaboration between four universities: Karolinska Institute, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm University and Uppsala University. SciLife Laboratory combines both frontline technical expertise with advanced knowledge of translational medicine and molecular biosciences. This enables researchers from all over Sweden, to have access to the technology and the expertise at SciLife Laboratory with subsidised costs, whilst the users from commercial companies pay the full costs of the performed analysis. SciLife Lab\'s aim is to build a strong research community through education and collaborative exchange. </p>\n<p>We arrived at SciLife Laboratory and were privileged to experience the beautiful architecture and surroundings that host this prestigious Institute. Our days involved several presentations and group meetings where many heads of departments met with us, allowed us to questioned them and proposed different strategies and solutions for developing KRISP into a successful molecular biosciences platform using their knowledge and experience they had gained over the years to prevent mistakes and streamline KRISP\'s growth. <b><i>\'One of the suggestions was that we work together with collaborators to design the projects and to write grants applications as this will ensure that appropriate data is produced and funding is available for advanced analysis\'</b></i>. </p><p>We met some amazing scientific collaborators and hope to work with them in the future and bring some of their expertise to KRISP through future scientific projects and research.  We eventually made our way to the airport on the Friday afternoon, nearly missing our flight and started our long trek back home, we were filled with excitement and optimism for building up the future of KRISP.  </p>\n\n\n', 'Nicolette Crozier, Benjamin Chimukangara, Veron Ramsuran', 'imgblog44.png', NULL, 'Meeting of the Swiss, Swedes and South Africans minds', '2017-07-25', 'imgblog44sm.png', 'VitalIT, Swiss Institute of bioinformatics, SIB, SciLifeLab,Geneva, Lausanne, ioannis Xenarios, bioinformatics, blog, travel, computational biology, KRISP, team, Nicolette Crozier, Veron.

(45, NULL, '<p>I was doing an all-night shift in the hospital where I\'m working this year when I received an e-mail offering a 1,000 USD Travel Fellowship to attend a conference in Eastern Europe. But in order to receive the grant I had to register for the conference (and pay the not insignificant fees) by 9am the next day. Classic 419 scam, right?</p>', '<p>Fortunately, it wasn\'t, and today I find myself in Prague, Czech Republic, buzzing after three days at the world\'s premier bioinformatics and computational biology meeting: the annual meeting of the International Society for Computational Biology, the 25th Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology Conference.</p>\n<p>I am an MSc candidate at KRISP, but this year I\'ve been a bit out of the scientific loop while completing my clinical community service at a small rural hospital in northern KwaZulu-Natal. In this small seven month small break, it feels like the ground has already shifted significantly. I am amazed at the work being done in the fields of personalised medicine, human-microbiome interactions and human data science. At times it felt a bit like I was an extra in a science fiction movie. I want to share a few highlights.</p>\n<br><p><b>1. Open Humans</b></p>\n<p>Madeleine Ball is the founder of the Open Humans Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation that seeks to give full control of personal genomic and health data to the individual from whom the data is collected. Currently this sort of data stays with the researchers who keep it safely locked away, inaccessible to the individuals or any scientist who may want to reuse the data. </p>\n<p>As could be predicted, the idea of sharing personally identifying data inspired some unease in the audience. Genetic discrimination. Uncovering the existence of a previously unknown relative. In discussing the various ethical, legal and social implications of personal data sharing, one delegate made an interesting point:</p>\n<p><b><i>\'A few decades ago a new technology was developed that could store personally identifying information such as disease risk profile, ethnicity or hidden parentage and there were similar concerns as those we\'re describing. But today just about everyone has a camera on their phone and shares photographs freely!\'</b></i></p>\n<br><p><b>2. Open Access Publishing</b></p>\n<p>The existing commercial scientific publishing model is as follows.</p>\n<p>- Public pays Scientist to do science.</p>\n<p>- Scientist does science.  </p>\n<p>- Scientist gives science to commercial Publisher, who does not pay Scientist, but takes over full copyright of science. Scientist may no longer share or use any of this work without Publisher\'s permission.</p>\n<p>- Reviewer, another scientist, reviews science but does not get paid for this service. </p>\n<p>- Science is published.</b></p>\n<p>- Public pays Publisher to access Science.</p>\n<p><b>See the problem?</b> The public pays twice. For a more comprehensive argument as to why scientific publishing needs an overhaul, see this piece in the Guardian.</p>\n<p>I had the pleasure of chatting to some of the Public Library of Science (PLoS) people at the conference. PLoS is a not-for-profit Open Access publisher, with a different funding model, allowing the public to pay for the science to be published and for the work to then be accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Commercial or Open Access, it is the same scientists do the same work, which is reviewed by the same peers, according to the same standards of scientific rigour. </p>\n<br><p><b>3. Open Data</b></p>\n<p>Fiona Nielsen started out as a frustrated PhD student, severely constrained by the inaccessibility of human genomic data, and has since transformed into an inspiring entrepreneur championing open data in human genomics. She was so determined that she established both a charity and a company in pursuit of the cause. She speaks about the FAIR principles of Open Data:</p>\n<p>1. Findable</p>\n<p>2. Accessible</p>\n<p>3. Interoperable</p>\n<p>4. Reusable</p>\n<p>Everyone loves a good acronym! She gave a keynote address at the Student Council Symposium and I want to be like her when I grow up. </p>\n<p>Here at KRISP we\'re developing a viral metagenomic pipeline, and access to suitable data for benchmarking remains a nightmare. I just hope that her company Repositive expands its services to include metagenomic data ASAP. </p>\n<br><p><b>4. Personalised medicine</b></p>\n<p>Christoph Bock delivered a keynote address entitled \'Bioinformatics for Personalized Medicine: Looking Beyond the Genome\' where he discussed how the complex function of our bodies requires trillions of individual cells to integrate, interact, and strike the right balance between stability and plasticity. This requires both the basic blueprint of all available possibilities as encoded in our genome, and other layers of regulation that switch on or turn off specific genes under appropriate circumstances. The latter is commonly referred to as the epigenome. With the use of CRISPR-cas9 technology we have the capacity to alter these epigenomic instructions, and thus influence the activity of our own genes. It is really quite fantastical. The best part? My colleague at KRISP, <a href=\"http://www.krisp.org.za/people.php?surname=Ramsuran\">Veron Ramsuran</a>, works precisely in this field. Maybe I didn\'t have to go all the way to Prague after all...</p>\n<p>I came back energised by all of the scientific ideas that we can implement in KRISP when I return, after only five more months of \'saving lives\'.</p>\n<br><p><i><b><a href=\"http://www.krisp.org.za/people.php?surname=Moosa\">Yumna Moosa</a> is an amateur mathematician who studied medicine by mistake, inspired by a naive desire to \'help people\'</b>. After completing her medical internship she came to her senses and registered for an MSc in Virology and Bioinformatics at KRISP, and is working to develop software for virome analysis. She is interested in human-microbiome interactions, and the way that these complex microbiological networks influence health and disease.

Standard genotypic resistance tests can only detect a resistance mutation if more than 20% of the viral population has developed this mutation. In the absence of drug pressure e.g. if a patient is not taking any ART at the moment, wild type virus will overtake the mutant viral strain since it is generally more fit. The mutant strain will then become a minority strain and will represent less than 20% of the total viral population in the plasma and will hence not be detected by genotypic testing. Once the patient has been taking ART for a few (approximately 6) weeks again, drug pressure will cause the mutant strain to emerge since wild type virus will be suppressed to minority levels.   <br><br>\rII.  Even though there are no resistance mutations detected at this time, we now know that the patient might still be harbouring some mutations. The most common mutations would be M184V giving resistance to 3TC -  and any of the NNRTI mutations, such as K103N. If TDF is added to the new regimen in the place of d4T, there is thus a chance that the patient might effectively be on TDF monotherapy. We have learned that TDF has a very low genetic barrier to resistance, especially in subtype C. Resistance will then develop rapidly and by the time that the clinician realises that the patient is failing therapy, she might have developed complete resistance to tenofovir, thereby compromising future treatment options.<br><br>', 'I.

M184V in contrast arises as a result of an A to G substitution (ATG, methionine to GTG, valine). M184I mutants are generally observed earlier during therapy than M184V as RT is more prone to G to A substitutions. M184I confers high-level resistance to 3TC and FTC but also significantly reduces the replication rate of the virus. In the presence of continued drug pressure, the frequency of M184V mutants increases, as the M184V mutants have a fitness advantage over M184I mutants. <br>\r<br>\rII.K65R confers hypersusceptibility to AZT by partially preventing the excision of incorporated AZT. This leads to increased stability of AZT as a chain terminator.

This case illustrates some of the deficiencies of existing diagnostics for TB. The DST result was received once the patient was well established on treatment and it was not brought to the attention of a doctor. The diagnostic test therefore did not lead to a beneficial outcome for the patient as the result was not appropriately acted upon. If the result was received at around two months, when the smears had not converted, then suspicion of further drug resistance should have prompted a repeat specimen for culture/DST. </p>\r<p>Having said all that, national and international guidelines do not give clear guidance on management of INH mono-resistant TB and are informed by poor quality evidence. Historically it was thought that standardised regimens were appropriate for INH mono-resistant disease but there is now increasing evidence that outcomes with standardised regimens are often poor.</p>\r<p>One option in this case would have been to continue rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide for a total duration of 6 months (this is recommended in US guidelines). This is, however, also not based on high quality evidence and there is an urgent need for better quality evidence to inform treatment strategies. </p>\r<P>II.

Under the original algorithm rifampicin resistance was defined with a difference between highest and lowest Ct >3.5. The algorithm was changed (to improve specificity of the assay) such that resistance is now defined with a difference between highest and lowest Ct >5. In this case the test would have been defined as resistant under the original algorithm (Difference between highest and lowest Ct = 3.6 [24.9-21.3])\0</p>\n<p>The reason that there is some signal from this probe rather than complete probe drop-out (contrast with the results shown for case 1) may be due to mixed populations of RIF-resistant and RIF-sensitive strains, which would make sense given what we know about the evolution of resistance in this case.

However, these series had inherent bias as aspirates were more likely to be performed when there was pre-existing concern about drug resistance. In addition this sub-district continues to have different epidemiology of drug resistance than elsewhere so the results may not be representative.

There is no evidence to inform the timing of ART specifically in drug-resistant TB but most practitioners would recommend initiation of ART within 4-8 weeks of the start of TB treatment, as long as the TB treatment is being tolerated. There is also no evidence on the optimal ART regimen. There are no known interactions between second-line TB drugs and NRTIs or NNRTIs so a standard first-line regimen can be used.

This molecular test has detected M. tuberculosis and at least one of the mutations in the rpoB gene which confer resistance to rifampicin. Rifampicin resistance is considered a reliable proxy for multidrug resistance (MDR) as rifampicin mono-resistance is relatively rare (>98% of rifampicin-resistant strains in the Xpert MTB/RIF demonstration study were MDR on conventional DST). </p>\r<p>Given the relatively high pre-test probability of TB in this case from the clinical features, the detection of M. tuberculosis in sputum is very likely to indicate active TB disease. </p>\r<p>The detection of rifampicin resistance is more complicated. In the large demonstration study for Xpert MTB/RIF, the sensitivity and specificity for detection of rifampicin resistance were 94.4% and 98.3% respectively (compared to the reference standard of phenotypic DST). To understand the significance of a positive result for rifampicin resistance, it is necessary to consider predictive values. Predictive values depend on the underlying prevalence of the condition in question. </p>\n <p>The table below shows how the positive predictive value (PPV) varies according to the prevalence of rifampicin resistance (i.e. the proportion of TB isolates that are rifampicin resistant) and illustrates how this would translate to true positive and false positive resistance results in a hypothetical population of 1000 TB cases. In South Africa, approximately 5% of all TB cases are rifampicin resistant so the PPV for rifampicin resistance if used in unselected TB cases would be approximately 74%. </p>\r<p>Certain groups have a much higher prevalence of rifampicin resistance, e.g. re-treatment cases and contacts of drug-resistant cases. Use in these selected groups will significantly reduce the occurrence of false positive rifampicin results. </p> <br>\r', '2', 1, 'clinical, case, tb, mtb, xdr, drug resistance, TB suspect , history , TB treatment, Xpert , MTB/RIF, test, GeneXpert', 'HIV-infected TB suspect with previous history of TB treatment: Xpert MTB/RIF test', '2012-01-20'),

Information should be sought regarding the susceptibility profile of the son TB isolates and his response to MDR-TB treatment. In this case it was determined that the son at baseline had pre-XDR-TB (resistance to kanamycin but not ofloxacin) and had remained smear and culture positive in the first six months of treatment. This might increase the likelihood that our patient has additional resistance and might also have an unfavourable response to standard MDR-TB treatment.

There is no evidence with which to guide antiretroviral regimen choice in patients on second-line TB drugs. It should be noted that ritonavir may interact with second-line TB drugs through inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system.

Central to this optimism is the recent empirical evidence from the Africa Centre published in the journal Science 2013 that convincingly showed at a population level that risk of acquiring HIV significantly declines with increasing coverage of ART. Indeed mathematical models suggest that the epidemic could halted by 2050 if high-levels of ART coverage are achieved (in combination with other effective interventions such as medical male circumcision). Key to devising the most efficient and cost-effective combination of interventions will be a clear understanding of patterns of HIV transmission in a typical rural African hyper-endemic setting. Recent methodological innovations in viral gene sequencing technology combined with a reduction in cost provide an unparalleled opportunity to understand patterns of HIV transmission and drug resistance and to establish the the most effective HIV prevention and treatment approaches in a typical rural sub-Saharan South African setting. </p>\n<p>Aims - The overall aim of the research is to quantify HIV transmission and drug resistance patterns and to identify the most effective combination of HIV prevention and treatment approaches in a hyperendemic rural South African setting. Our specific objectives are to: </p>\n<p>1. Use molecular epidemiological approaches to develop a clear understanding of HIV transmission dynamics in a typical rural African population and to characterize the individuals and sub-populations responsible for a disproportionately large number of transmission events. </p>\n<p>2. Identify clinical, demographic, genetic and social factors associated with failure of antiretroviral treatment and development of drug resistance in a rural primary health care-based public HIV treatment and care programme. </p>\n<p>3. Optimise scientific collaboration between phylogeneticists, geneticists, geographers, public health professionals, health economists, computer scientists, social scientists, modelers and epidemiologists from the Africa Centre, UKZN and external organizations to develop new approaches to address the overarching aim and objectives 1 and 2. </p>\n<p>4. To rapidly translate scientific findings into policy by ensuring close collaboration with the National Department of Health and international health policies agencies </p>\n<p>Methods - The proposal brings together a diverse set of experts to identify the most effective combination of HIV prevention interventions through a thorough exploration of the social, epidemiological and molecular characteristics of HIV transmission networks and the quantification of emergence of drug resistance. Furthermore, as a matter of urgency given decreasing support for global HIV programmes, we will combine these results with cost data to directly inform the most cost-effective combination of interventions (measured in terms of cost per HIV infection averted). </p>\n<p>We will genetically sequence existing blood samples from 4,000 HIV positive individuals identified through the Africa Centres annual population-based HIV surveillance (2004-2012) and from 600 HIV individuals failing ART resident in the Africa Centres surveillance area, for whom socio-demographic and clinical data are available since 2000. This dataset will be added to ?1,500 genotypes already produced at Africa Centre. We will then apply molecular epidemiological techniques to describe the characteristics of HIV transmission networks and statistical techniques to identify factors associated to the development of drug resistance in the study population. Additional data mining and machine learning techniques may also be applied to these problems. These results will be combined with detailed demographic information to identify key characteristics of transmitters. This data will further be combined with approximately 10,000 HIV sequences from other settings in South Africa, generated by the SATuRN consortium, to determine the impact of imported strains on the local transmission dynamics. The SATuRN data and the data from patients failing ART in the Africa Centre DSS will be used to identify factors determining failure and drug resistance development in order to devise strategies to decrease to prevent a drug resistant epidemic. </p>\n<p>Anticipated outcomes - Identification of the most effective HIV prevention and treatment approaches based on clear understanding of the patterns and determinants of HIV transmission and drug resistance acquisition in a typical rural sub-Saharan South African setting.</p>', 'UKZNHIVEPI, SAMRC, epidemiology, phylogenetics, HIV, geographic information system, drug resistance', NULL, 'phylogenetics', 'epidemiology', '99AW', 'HIV', 'SAMRC', NULL, NULL, '2014-04-01', '2019-03-31'),

The Workshop will host local HIV and TB physicians from across Botswana, South Africa and neighbouring countries, who will be trained on the optimum management of HIV and TB treatment failures, given the treatment resources available. Overall, 225 local and international participants are expected to attend.</p>\r<p>While resistance to antiretroviral (ARV) medication has not become a threat to regional treatment programmes yet, as sure a night follows day, the continued expansion of antiretroviral therapy will be followed by an increase in HIV antiretroviral drug resistance over time.  Nearly every major infectious disease has developed resistance to drugs commonly used for treatment.  Drug resistance in tuberculosis is a well-described and longstanding problem. With the recent increases in multiple TB drug resistance and the outbreak of extremely-drug resistant tuberculosis, clinicians and public health officials need to be on heightened alert for the possibility of drug resistance, seek training in the management of drug-resistant cases and increase efforts to monitor and control its transmission.</p>\r<p>At present, Botswana has placed 171,065 adults and children on ARVs, which accounts to nearly 10% of its population.  South Africa has now over 1.2 million patients on ARVs.  While much care, financial resources and great effort has been generated to ensure the expansion of these programmes, the same level of attention has not given to the management of patients failing ARV and TB treatment with resistance strains. One reason for this is that drug resistance testing is expensive, time consuming and dependent on high-level technology (such as genetics, biotechnology and bioinformatics). However, this situation is now changing.</p>\r<p>The good news is that recent advances in technologies and effective collaboration between the Botswana Ministry of Health and partnerships with South African academic organizations, government and biotechnology companies allow resistance genotype tests to be reduced in price from approximately ZAR 3,300 per test to less than ZAR 1,000 per test. However, even at the higher of these prices it is known resistance testing is cost-neutral to ARV programmes as its saves unnecessary switches to more complex and costly ARV treatment regimens by providing valuable information to the physician/nurse to better manage patients failing on ARVs. Discounted resistance test capacity will soon be available at national scale in Botswana and South Africa.  </p>\r<p>Experts from academia, industry and government institutions in the region have collaborated in the development of the discounted HIV resistance test under the leadership of SATuRN. <b><i>\'SATuRN is an exciting academic and government collaboration that provides access to resistance interpretation to clinicians at primary health care facilities and allows comprehensive surveillance of the levels of resistance in the region</b></i>\', said Dr. Tulio de Oliveira, one of the organizers of the meeting, who is from the Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies, University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), a rural HIV & TB treatment and research centre in South Africa.</p>\r<p>Although drug resistance is a growing concern, effective partnerships between researchers, clinicians, and public health officials can ensure that resistance levels are accurately traced and managed. Dr. Tendani Gaolathe, speaking on behalf of the Botswana Ministry of Health explained, <b><i>\'Information and training on HIV and TB resistance is urgently needed to guide treatment options and to ensure that southern Africa\'s HIV & TB treatment programmes are highly effective and financially sustainable</b></i>\'.  Dr. Madisa Mine, director of the HIV Reference Laboratory, added, <b><i>\'Developing the capacity of laboratory scientists to meet the future challenges that long-term ARV use pose will go far to safe-guard the gains made in Botswana\'s fight against HIV and TB.</b></i>\' </p>\r<p>In addition, the workshop will also launch an open access book on HIV / TB drug resistance and clinical management that will be available free of charge.

It also revealed that South Africa had the lowest resistance rate (at 1.1%), while Uganda had the highest (at 12.3%).</p>\r<p>\rResearchers attributed the high rate in the East African country to the fact that ART was started earlier there than in the other five countries.</p>\r<p>\rIt also highlighted that countries scaling up their ART programmes, like South Africa, were at a greater risk of increased resistance as more people defaulted on treatment, developed resistance and then transmitted HIV-drug resistance to their partners.</p>\r<p>\rDr Francesca Conradie from the Clinical HIV Research Unit at the University of Witwaters-rand and co-author of the study, said primary HIV-drug resistance was not at the stage where it could be considered an \'<b><i>emergency\'</b></i> in South Africa.

But European scientists who gained access to the hospital\'s records in 2004 discovered that 32 of the infected children had been treated at the hospital before the accused medics had even arrived. Also, the diversity of viruses, which include several strains of hepatitis in addition to HIV, suggested a classic hospital outbreak due to poor hygiene practices rather than a deliberate inoculation from a single source. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>The new genetic analysis of the viruses tells a similar story. <b><i>A team led by Tulio de Oliveira & Oliver Pybus, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oxford, U.K., obtained blood samples from 66 of the Libyan children who had been sent to European hospitals for care.</b></i> They extracted and sequenced RNA from 41 strains of HIV as well as 61 strains of hepatitis C virus infecting the children.

European governments and the United States stand accused of abandoning the medical workers for powerful strategic and economic reasons. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>\'We are still hoping wisdom will prevail,\' said the head of the nurses\' defence team, French lawyer Emmanuel Altit. \'The court has not granted the defence its rights, the Libyan evidence in the case is discredited, and the medics\' confessions were extracted under mental, physical and sexual torture.\' </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>The six - Dr Ashraf al-Hajuj and nurses Kristiyana Vatcheva, Nasya Nenova, Valentina Siropulo, Valya Chervenyashka and Snezhana Dimitrova - took up government contracts at the hospital in Libya\'s second city in March 1998. The first cases of HIV infection were reported the same year. A World Health Organisation report found that the virus had probably been spread because of a lack of proper medical equipment. The six were imprisoned in March 1999. Libyan courts ordered reports from the world\'s top Aids scientists and epidemiologists, including Luc Montagnier, one of the discoverers of HIV.

Earlier this year Libya said Bulgaria should pay the families of the children $2.7bn (£1.8bn) in compensation - which is exactly the sum paid by Libya for the 270 lives lost in the Pan Am 103 bombing.

Roberts, like many scientists, was shocked at how scientific evidence exonerating the medical workers had been ignored, and decided to do something about it. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>For Roberts, a 1993 Nobel laureate in medicine or physiology, it was the start of a relentless commitment. Over the past nine months, he has had a string of meetings with top-level diplomats, and on 10 June he even flew to Libya for a late-night meeting at the Corinthian Hotel in Tripoli with Seif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, to try to help find a solution. </p>\r<p></p>\r<p>Roberts has also spent endless hours gathering an eventual 120 signatures from Nobel laureates, a record , for an open letter to Muammar al-Gaddafi. <b><i>\'A miscarriage of justice will take place without proper consideration of scientific evidence\'</b></i>, warned the letter (see Nature 444, 146; 2006).

International participants are from the following institutions: John Hopkins School of Medicine, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Stanford University.</p>\n\r<p>In this first SATuRN Comprehensive Analysis Meeting, the focus will be on analyzing the vast amount of data that has recently become available from several independent surveys of drug resistance in the region. This group will use these data to learn more about the current situation and to suggest ways that treatment programmes could be improved. Their responsibility as scientists and doctors is to analyze and interpret this data rigorously and then share that information as widely as possible, most importantly with the policy makers at the Department of Health, so that the information can be used to improve care for people living with HIV in this region. Thus far, results from these independent surveys show both good and bad news for the region. The good news is that ARV treatment has expanded very fast and now includes over 1,3 million individuals, it has saved 1000s of lives and there is little evidence that transmission of drug resistant viruses from people on treatment to uninfected people is a problem (<5%). The bad news, however, is that a growing number of HIV infected individuals on treatment start to develop high-level resistance after only a few years on life-long ARV therapy. </p>\r\r<p>SATuRN\'s first Analysis Meeting comes after years of preparation and a sustained and collaborative effort to collate the largest drug resistance dataset ever produced in southern Africa. <b><i>\'The data contains over 7,000 genetic (i.e. DNA) codes of drug resistance viruses in the region, and detailed clinical, and in some cases social information, on the patients failing treatment\'</b></i> says Dr. Tulio de Oliveira, a bioinformatician from the Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies at UKZN and the co-director of SATuRN. He continues <b><i>\'The genetic code of the virus is used to estimate the presence of drug resistance and, if combined with other associated data, it can shed light on the reasons for the development of resistance, which, in many cases, may be social rather than clinical.\'</b></i> </p>\r\r<p><b><i>\'All patient information is anonymous and has been collected following stringent academic ethics reviews. It is made available on what are considered to be the two best drug resistance databases in the world.\'</b></i> says Dr. Cloete Van Vurren, a specialized HIV physician and researcher from the University of the Free State.

In Asia, the results varied too greatly among countries to assess an overall trend for the region.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The study authors said the rates of increase were expected, but they warned that the situation requires careful monitoring to make sure the problem doesn\'t escalate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><i>\'The good news is that it\'s still modest, contained, and not alarming,\'</b></i> <b><i>said Dr. Silvia Bertagnolio of the World Health Organization</b></i>, who presented a related study this week at the International AIDS Conference in Washington. <b><i>\'But we have to be vigilant\'</b></i> to make sure the rates don\'t keep going up, she added.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>HIV becomes drug-resistant through random mutations that occur when the virus copies its genetic material. Antiretroviral medications prevent HIV from replicating, but if a person doesn\'t take these pills daily, drug resistance can arise.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Taking pills every day for life is a challenging order, and many people may lapse without proper support or access to clinics. Patchy supplies of drugs in developing countries can also interrupt treatment. And the new push to start treatment earlier to help prevent the transmission of HIV increases the odds that someone will develop drug resistance over his or her lifetime.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>HIV may develop resistance to one type of medication but not others. Catching resistance early and switching a patient\'s medication attacks HIV from a different angle. This type of surveillance is essential to keep drug resistance from running rampant, Bertagnolio said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, drug resistance monitoring is not available in many poorer parts of the word.  And once people develop resistance to the standard first-line drugs, they must switch to more potent second-line medications that are in short supply in many developing countries. Continued spread of drug resistance could jeopardize efforts to curtail the AIDS epidemic in the developing world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bertagnolio said the WHO report reveals that many clinics lose contact with up to one-third of the people who start antiretroviral treatment. Following up with all patients is a key to ensuring they take their medication without fail.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In light of these results, <b><i>\'the greatest challenge is to reduce the frequency of treatment failure and cases of drug resistance\', Dr. Douglas Richman, director of the Center for AIDS Research at UC San Diego</b></i>, wrote in a commentary also published in Lancet. <b><i>\'Weak drug supply chains and drug stock-outs jeopardize the treatment of even highly adherent patients.\'</b></i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Richman pointed out that health officials in the United States in Europe also faced the risk of increasing HIV drug resistance as treatment became more widespread, but doctors and patients have filled in the gaps to keep resistance from rising.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In a related study presented at the AIDS conference, researchers from South Africa found that about 20% of patients treated in 17 rural clinics there were failing their first-line drug treatment. Members of the team analyzed samples of HIV collected from 240 of the patients and found that 87% had some kind of mutation for drug resistance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At least 1.8 million people in South Africa currently receive treatment, <b><i>said Justen Manasa, a doctoral student in virology at the University of KwaZulu-Natal</b></i> who presented the study results on Tuesday. <b><i>\'The rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy in South Africa has put enormous strain on health systems,\'</b></i> he said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Manasa said these rates of drug resistance are not unique to South Africa - Botswana and Zimbabwe show similar trends.</p>', 'hiv, drug, resistance, increase, africa, hlabisa, rural, south africa, justen manasa, la times, news', 'HIV drug resistance is spreading in Africa, experts say. by By Erin Loury, Washington during the AIDS 2012 international conference.', NULL),

One country\'s fight to get the ancient scourge under control has an unlikely hero: a simple diagnostic test.</p>', NULL, NULL, '<p><img src=\"imagesBIO/feature.tbx588.jpg\"><b><i>Figure 1 - TB bacteria in a GeneXpert cartridge (blue, foreground) can be detected in under two hours. Sputum samples (purple and green caps) take weeks to culture.</b></i></p>\n<p>KwaMsane Township sits amid rolling hills in South Africa\'s KwaZulu-Natal Province. Drive 30 minutes to the west and elephants, giraffes, zebras, and rhinos often stroll by the side of a highway that cuts through a game park. A few kilometers to the east lie sprawling sugarcane fields, which shimmer in the subtropical sun and appear to spill into the Indian Ocean. KwaMsane is beautiful, but it has one of the world\'s highest rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, an often fatal form of the disease.</p>\n<p>In November 2011, Jabu Ngcobo, 25, felt a pain in her side and went to the KwaMsane clinic, which resembles a trailer park. The clinic\'s trailers \'called parkhomes here\' surround a small covered courtyard that serves as a waiting room, with patients sitting in plastic chairs. \'I was all along thinking I had MDR TB because my two brothers and my sister had it,\' says Ngcobo.</p>\n<p>Her siblings learned they had the dangerous form of the disease only after giving sputum samples, which had to be transported to a laboratory in Durban, 275 kilometers to the south. The lab then had to nurture cultures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis until the colonies were large enough to be subjected to drug susceptibility tests. At best, the process takes six weeks; in reality, given the need to transport the samples, the likelihood of lab backlogs, and delays in reporting the results, three months often pass before patients in rural towns like KwaMsane learn whether they will benefit from a relatively simple, six-month course of antibiotics or instead need an 18-month barrage of heavy-duty drugs. The delay can mean the difference between permanent lung damage, or even death, and recovering with no long-term consequences.</p>\n<p>Ngcobo indeed had the drug-resistant form of TB ?and she began treatment the next day. Richard Lessells, a Scottish physician who treated her and her family members at KwaMsane clinic, notes that for Ngcobo\'s siblings, the months that passed without proper treatment came at a steep cost: one of her brothers suffered lung damage that will never heal. Jabu, in contrast, had no detectable levels of the bacteria a month after diagnosis, because she immediately started taking 22 pills a day as well as injections of anti-TB drugs.</p>\n<p>Ngcobo\'s speedy diagnosis and recovery were made possible by a machine called a GeneXpert, which sits atop a counter inside one of the trailers and resembles a high-end espresso maker. Although the advanced molecular tricks it uses to identify the DNA of M. tuberculosis would have been unimaginable outside a state-of-the-art biology lab a few years ago, the device is simple to use. A technician squirts a sputum sample from a patient into what looks like a printer cartridge and then clicks that into the machine, which performs a reaction that amplifies specific bits of M. tuberculosis DNA if they are present. Fluorescent molecules light up when they come in contact with the targeted DNA, and the machine detects the fluorescence, sending the information to a computer. The entire process takes a mere two hours. Not only can GeneXpert detect the presence of the TB-causing bacteria, but it can accurately determine whether the bacterial DNA has the mutations known to make the disease resistant to the most commonly used drug.</p>\n<p>Tuberculosis, which routinely spreads through the air, infects one-third of the human population. For almost all of those people it\'s harmless, and most don\'t even know they have been infected. And for much of the world, it is a disease mainly of historical significance. But in many poor countries, particularly in much of central and southern Africa, it remains at epidemic proportions. In 2011, an estimated 8.7 million people became sick from M. tuberculosis. Roughly 1.4 million people die of TB each year; HIV is the only infectious agent that kills more.</p>\n<p><img src=\"imagesBIO/feature.tb3_.jpg\"></p><p><b><i>Figure 2 - Durban TB doctor Iqbal Master welcomes the GeneXpert but says it creates many challenges.</b></i></p>\n<p>One critical reason this epidemic continues is that there\'s no effective and affordable way to tell who is infected. TB goes undiagnosed in some three million people each year. Some simply are never tested. Others, because of antiquated diagnostic technologies, are wrongly given a clean bill of health. Traditional diagnosis for TB relies on staining a sputum sample with dyes and then examining a slide under a microscope to look for the bacteria. This \'smear\' test, developed 125 years ago, detects fewer than 60 percent of all cases and doesn\'t identify drug resistant strains. The more precise culture test to determine sensitivity to certain drugs takes longer, costs more, and needs to be done in a well-equipped lab so it is used sparingly. That means roughly 80 percent of the drug-resistant cases in the world go undetected, according to the World Health Organization. Together, these undiagnosed individuals represent a vast reservoir for the bacteria, including drug-resistant strains. Infection flourishes and leapfrogs through communities, devastating the most vulnerable people, such as those already weakened by HIV.</p>\n<p>A practical, quick, and powerful diagnostic tool could change that deadly dynamic. Brought to market by a public-private partnership between the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics in Geneva, Switzerland, and Cepheid, a manufacturer based in Sunnyvale, California, the GeneXpert TB detection machine gained approval from the WHO in December 2010. A few months later, South Africa\'s health minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, compared the machines to \'bazookas\' in the war against TB and pledged to place them in each of the country\'s 52 districts.</p>\n<p>The GeneXpert machine alone will not be enough to break the back of the massive TB problem in South Africa or anywhere else. That would probably take a powerful vaccine combined with much more potent drugs than now exist. But meanwhile, for countries walloped by TB, including increasing numbers of cases resistant to increasing numbers of drugs, such a diagnostic tool is a crucial and necessary first step. Deploying it widely throughout a country like South Africa, where much of the population lacks access to advanced medical care, will be a logistical and financial challenge. But failing to do so could be deadly. To understand the stakes, it is worth considering the outbreak a few years ago of a nightmare TB strain just a few hundred kilometers from KwaMsane Township.</p>\n<p><big><b>Dreams</b></big></p>\n<p>One of the most frightening aspects of TB is that humans have treated it with such indifference. All too often, patients start treatment, soon feel better, and then stop taking their pills or take them only sporadically. This creates a perfect opportunity for resistance to develop, because the bacteria with mutations that make them least susceptible to the drug will be likely to survive the incomplete treatment. Then there is the scariest scenario of all: inappropriately diagnosed or incompletely treated MDR TB can foster \'extensively\' drug-resistant (XDR) mutants that dodge two of the main classes of TB drugs. An outbreak of just such a strain was reported for the first time in 2006. And it took place in KwaZulu-Natal.</p>\n<p>Tugela Ferry, about a four-hour drive from KwaMsane Township, is a small town in the central part of the province. In August 2006, headlines around the world described the startling news that 52 of 53 TB patients who had checked into the Church of Scotland Hospital there had died on average, within 16 days of admission. Tests later revealed that they had XDR strains. The outbreak forced South Africa to look long and hard at the public-health failures that had allowed these dangerous strains to evolve and spread. Front and center was the lack of appropriate diagnostic tools. Given that even under ideal circumstances it would take more than a month to diagnose drug-resistant TB, the patients had no chance: all died before they ever learned they had a deadly form of the disease.</p>\n<p><img src=\"imagesBIO/feature.tb5_.jpg\"></p><p><b><i>Figure 3 - Technician Gregory Mkhize shows off the largest GeneXpert machine in Africa, at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital. It can process 48 samples at once.</b></i></p>\n<p>In the wake of Tugela Ferry, the government designated wards at King George V Hospital, a 75-year-old TB facility in Durban, solely for drug-resistant cases. The goal was both to improve treatment outcomes and to slow the spread of the disease. The hospital has seven wards with 32 beds each, including one devoted exclusively to children. There\'s a waiting list to get in, although Iqbal Master, the doctor who manages the program, is proud that all sick patients, and those with XDR TB, are now admitted within a few weeks of being referred; in January 2007, delays ran to four months. \'We had patients dying while on a waiting list,\' he says.</p>\n<p>Patients like Nomthandzau Elizabeth Mjwara, a 48-year-old woman who has HIV and MDR TB, are grateful to secure one of the 224 beds. \'It\'s like I\'m staying at my home,\' says Mjwara, who has lived in the hospital since April. After she fell seriously ill, four months passed before she sought care, gave a sputum sample, received her TB diagnosis, and was admitted to King George V to begin treatment. Many HIV-infected patients arrive at the hospital at such an advanced stage of AIDS that even the proper TB treatment is too little, too late. Fortunately, despite the diagnostic delays, Mjwara still had enough of an immune system left to respond to the drugs.</p>\n<p>Despite the upbeat attitude of patients like Mjwara and the first-rate care they receive, many at King George V suffer from advanced cases of TB, and many leave in coffins. The ones who survive, like Mjwara, have to endure several months of painful daily injections that can cause hearing loss and psychosis. Coughs punctuate the wards day and night, and to discourage airborne infection, windows stay open even when the temperature drops.</p>\n<p><big><b><i>Almost everything positive that\'s said about tuberculosis is followed by a \'but.\'</b></big></i></p>\n<p>Most of the doctors and nurses who work the ward wear face masks. Master pointedly does not, in part because the patients with hearing loss rely heavily on reading lips. He has a sympathetic and wistful smile, accented by a wise man\'s bushy salt-and-pepper beard. \'The beard protects me from TB,\' Master jokes.</p>\n<p>If GeneXpert is used effectively in South Africa, it will ultimately ease pressures on hospitals like King George V, slowing the spread of resistant cases by speeding their detection and starting people on the proper treatment earlier. However, almost everything positive that\'s said about TB is followed by a \'but,\' and Master is quick to stress the limitations of the technology. One is technical. Culture tests remain more accurate than GeneXpert. What\'s more, testing of cultures remains the only way to accurately diagnose XDR TB. Finally, the aggressive drive to start using GeneXpert countrywide is taxing the health-care system. While identifying those with the active disease will provide a long-term public-health benefit, it will increase the immediate number of patients seeking medical care. Master cites studies suggesting that GeneXpert will increase the patient load by up to 500 percent in the short term. \'They haven\'t sorted out the logistics of what\'s the ideal way to roll out GeneXpert,\' he says. \'It\'s going to take time.\'</p>\n<p>On a brisk September morning, Master stops by Mjwara\'s bed and admires one of her many craft projects, a desktop pencil holder she fashioned from empty toilet paper rolls and tongue depressors. \'So that\'s where my tongue depressors went!\' he teases. Her sweatshirt has a word stitched across it: \'Dreams.\'</p>\n<p><big><b>Waiting for a Vaccine</big></b></p>\n<p>Although many parts of South Africa are wealthy, Durban\'s Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital is a reminder that much of the country is still extremely poor and lacks modern medical facilities. The 1,200-bed hospital has guards at its entrance, narrow halls filled with sickly patients, and crowds of people constantly moving down the corridors. Durban doctors who do not work there often roll their eyes at the mention of its name, and recent news stories recount problems with a shortage of staff, long lines at the dispensary, security lapses (including a missing dead body), and an outbreak of bacterial infection that killed five babies. But on the grounds of this sprawling hospital is the largest GeneXpert machine in Africa. Unveiled by Health Minister Motsoaledi on World TB Day in March 2011, the mammoth machine is two meters tall and 2.5 meters long. It can process 48 cartridges at a time; they move through the contraption by means of conveyor belts and a robotic arm.</p>\n<p>A few years ago Motsoaledi helped lead a successful countrywide campaign to test 15 million people for HIV and administer retroviral drugs to everyone with a severely damaged immune system. Now he\'s optimistic that GeneXpert, which he vowed would be in every public facility in South Africa that needed one by the end of 2012, will \'revolutionize\' the control of tuberculosis. \'When we launched the campaign [to test for HIV] in 2010, there was no GeneXpert, so the TB screening was done with five questions,\' Motsoaledi says. \'Just asking five questions and deciding on the basis of your answers?\' he asks incredulously. \'Now in most of the testing stations we make sure that GeneXpert is there.\'</p>\n<p><big><b><i>The costs of the diagnostic machines are dwarfed by the expense of providing months of hospital care for TB patients.</big></b></i></p>\n<p>But merely having the machines isn\'t enough. On one weekday in September, the 48-cartridge machine at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital was running only one sample. That\'s because the rapid scale-up of advanced TB testing has stressed the system to the buckling point. Only one supplier provides cartridges, and there already have been shortages, leading to a \'huge backlog of unprocessed specimens,\' says Stephen Carpenter, clinical manager of the Don McKenzie Hospital in Botha Hills, outside Durban. GeneXpert had yet to reach his own hospital. \'We were promised that it would be rolled out all over the province and the district, but there have been all sorts of financial and logistical delays,\' he says.</p>\n<p><img src=\"imagesBIO/feature.tb6_.jpg\"></p><p><b><i>Figure 4 - Because GeneXpert doesn\'t require culturing TB, it reduces risks to lab workers.</b></i></p>\n<p>Indeed, deploying GeneXpert requires a significant investment by South Africa\'s government. A four cartridge machine with a desktop computer sells for $17,000, and cartridges go for $9.98. Analyses show that a GeneXpert test in South Africa, including staff time and machine maintenance, costs roughly $25 per sample, versus $3 for a sputum smear and $12 to $16 for a culture. The increased cost is offset to a degree by the fact that GeneXpert incorporates resistance testing traditional drug sensitivity testing for first-line treatments costs $72 per test but all told, a paper published by PLOS ONE found, South Africa will have to spend 55 percent more per suspected TB case if it fully scales up the use of the technology as planned.</p>\n<p>The flip side is that the country will receive serious bang for its rand, because the costs of the machine are dwarfed by the expense of providing months of hospital care for TB patients. \'The diagnosis costs are a very, very small fraction of the total TB control program, and there\'s substantial benefit,\' says Mark Nicol, a clinical microbiologist who has a joint appointment at the University of Cape Town and the government\'s National Health Laboratory Service. Nicol notes that poorer countries with high TB burdens will need outside help. \'But it\'s a price that South Africa certainly can afford,\' he says.</p>\n<p>He is not alone in considering the test worthwhile. \'GeneXpert has transformed the way we diagnose TB,\' says Nesri Padayatchi, who previously managed the TB wards at King George V and now works across town on TB and HIV at the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa. But here comes the inevitable \'but\': \'You can identify all these patients, but it\'s not addressing the central problem.\' TB clinicians like Padayatchi have long dreamed of better medicines to both prevent and treat the disease. A TB vaccine was actually introduced nearly a century ago and is widely used. But so much controversy surrounds its efficacy that the United States, for one, does not generally recommend it. \'It\'s a wonder vaccine you wonder whether it works,\' jokes Padayatchi. Eleven TB vaccines are currently in clinical trials, a reflection of the intense efforts over the past decade to rejuvenate the field, but none has yet warranted a full-scale efficacy study. The World Health Organization estimates that the earliest a vaccine could be licensed is 2020.</p>\n<p><img src=\"imagesBIO/feature.tb7_.jpg\"></p><p><b><i>Figure 5 - Jabu Ngcobo developed drug-resistant TB but was quickly diagnosed with GeneXpert and recovered fully.</b></i></p>\n<p>As for treatments, no new class of TB drugs has come to market in 40 years, though two are expected to finish human testing this year; each appears to work against resistant strains. Nine other compounds are at various stages of human studies. Still, the future of these drugs remains uncertain.</p>\n<p>International health agencies have agreed on a plan to reduce TB to less than one case per million people by 2050. That would be a drop from 8.7 million cases globally today to roughly 7,000. The partnership specifies that the key to success is an effective vaccine combined with treatments capable of defeating drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis within two months. There is no guarantee, of course, that either of those will be developed by 2050. But GeneXpert can at least move the world closer to the goal of nearly eliminating this disease.</p>\n', 'MIT, technology, review, richard Lessells, KwaMsane, KwaZulu-Natal, TB, drug resistance, resistant, MDR, XDR, pre-XDR, GeneXpert, Jabu Ngcobo, John Cohen, south africa, RIF, MIT, technology, review, richard Lessells, KwaMsane, KwaZulu-Natal, TB, drug resistance, resistant, MDR, XDR, pre-XDR, GeneXpert, Jabu Ngcobo, John Cohen, south africa, RIF, SATuRN, news, MIT, technology, review, richard Lessells, KwaMsane, KwaZulu-Natal, TB, drug resistance, resistant, MDR, XDR, pre-XDR, GeneXpert, Jabu Ngcobo, John Cohen, south africa, RIF', 'By Jon Cohen on December 11, 2012 - Nearly 1.5 million people die from tuberculosis every year, even though most cases can be cured with routine antibiotic treatments.

Second, common traits or annotations: if the phylotype root has a unique annotation A (which is conserved), then all members of the phylotype also have annotation A.</p>\n\n<p>The term phylotype is common in microbiology, and refers to a (taxon-neutral) classification based on phylogenetic relationship to other organisms.</p>\n\n<p>Method: Infer ancestral annotations using maximum parsimony. Use this annotation to induce a set of phylotypes, defined by MRCA and path-conservation. Apply combinatorial, numerical, and statistical criteria to select relevant phylotypes.</p>\n\n<p>One example is the study of the origin of the <a href=\"ppublications.php?pubid=15\">Albanian HIV epidemic</a>.', 'pirate, science, pirate science, phylotypes, searching for phylotypes, interface, between, science, society, open access, pirate, science, pirate science, phylotypes, searching for phylotypes, interface, between, science, society, open access, pirate, science, pirate science, phylotypes, searching for phylotypes, interface, between, science, society, open access', 'Pirate Science recreates the interface between science and society by reviewing and publishing online comments about important and open access publications.

The country also has a massive tuberculosis (TB) epidemic, and TB/HIV co-infection is a common challenge for clinicians. The increasing number of patients who are infected with drug-resistant strains of TB and/ or HIV in Southern Africa poses a mounting threat to successful treatment. Drug-resistance testing for patients failing therapy is available at reference laboratories, which contrasts the situation in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. This provides an important tool to protect the sustained effectiveness of available TB and HIV therapies; however, interpretation of drug resistance reports is complex and expert guidance to clinicians may be required for optimal clinical management. </p>\n<p>In this context, the recently published HIV & TB Drug Resistance & Clinical Management Case Book by Rossouw, Lessells and de Oliveira, is an important aid to clinicians in SA and beyond, who are managing complex cases of patients with HIV and TB drug resistance. It provides a comprehensive background to the development of drug resistance as well as up-to-date clinical knowledge on how to diagnose and manage drug-resistant infections. The book uses an instructive casebased learning approach, with 14 HIV and 6 TB cases. After a brief review of technical details, each clinical case is presented in a structured manner. The description of the case is followed by the clinical chart and drug-resistance results. The drugresistance report is translated into a clear and evidence-based recommendation for clinical management. Lessons from each case are excellently summarised in <b><i>\'key learning points\'</b></i>. The cases cover diverse and illustrative examples of adult and paediatric patients with therapy failure, thus addressing actual problems that clinicians will deal with in daily practice. </p>\n<p><b><i>Many of the cases in the book highlight errors in management that contributed to the emergence of drug resistance. These \'preventable\' cases of drug resistance provide important lessons; avoiding these mistakes will advance clinical practice and benefit patients. Preventing acquired drug resistance in patients receiving treatment will also have major public health consequences, as these cases are the source of onward transmission of drug resistance to newly infected individuals.</b></i> </p>\n<p>A common feature of the HIV cases is that they used the SATuRN RegaDB drug resistance database to construct a complete clinical chart and resistance report for each patient. This database conveniently summarises all clinical and laboratory information into a clinical chart including treatment history, CD4 counts and viral load results. It also interprets the drug-resistance genotype using the Stanford HIVDB algorithm. The SATuRN information management system provides an excellent example of how bioinformatics tools can be utilised to the benefit of the physician and patient. </p>\n<p>In conclusion, this book is an excellent practical compendium of knowledge in the field of HIV and TB drug resistance, set in the highly relevant context of Southern Africa where drugresistant strains of HIV and TB are increasingly reported. It provides expert guidance in difficult clinical situations and explains the steps to be taken to prevent the emergence and transmission of drug resistance. This book highlights the fact that education and training are fundamental steps in the implementation of technologies such as viral-load and drugresistance testing, so that they can be used to full advantage. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><i>Authors:</b></i></p>\n<p>K C E Sigaloff, MD, PhD </p>\n<p>R L Hamers, MD, PhD </p>\n<p>Department of Global Health, Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</p>\n<p><b><i>Download:</b></i><a href=\"manuscripts/Sigaloff_Hamers_BookReview2013.pdf\"> full-text book review article</a>.</p>\n', 'book, review, hiv, tb, drug resistance, clinical management, southern African journal of HIV medicine, sigaloff, hamers, de oliveira, Lessells, Rossouw,book, review, hiv, tb, drug resistance, clinical management, southern African journal of HIV medicine, sigaloff, hamers, de oliveira, Lessells, Rossouw,book, review, hiv, tb, drug resistance, clinical management, southern African journal of HIV medicine, sigaloff, hamers, de oliveira, Lessells, Rossouw,book, review, hiv, tb, drug resistance, clinical management, southern African journal of HIV medicine, sigaloff, hamers, de oliveira, Lessells, Rossouw', 'BOOK REVIEW - ?HIV & TB Drug Resistance & Clinical Management Case Book? by Sigaloff & Hamers, The Southern African Journal of HIV Medicine Book Review on the HIV & TB Drug Resistance & Clinical Management Case Book by Rossouw, Lessells and de Oliveira\n', NULL),

The discussion was hosted by the University of KwaZulu-Natal\'s College of Health Sciences on the theme \'Putting the \'I\' back into HIV\' new approaches in developing person-centred interventions to fight the epidemic\'.</p>\n\n<p>UKZN Deputy Vice-Chancellor and College head Professor Rob Slotow introduced the panel of speakers as individuals who had led significant contributions to HIV science which have been translated into national and international health policy.  This new knowledge had enabled health leadership, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal, to mobilise the roll-back of HIV.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking on the prospects of a viable HIV vaccine, Professor Thumbi Ndung\'u of the KwaZulu-Natal Research Institute for TB and HIV (K-RITH) said that although research had not yet yielded a vaccine solution eligible for licencing, there was evidence that a vaccine is possible. Animal studies were working on vectors that can produce immune system responses with 50% protection rates; antibodies from HIV-positive patients were being tested to block the virus in uninfected subjects; computational biologists were creating sequence diversity to corner off the virus and its pathways, providing no escape from the body\'s immune response. </p>\n\n<p><b><i>\'An HIV vaccine is an enormous challenge,\'</b></i> he explained, <b><i>\'because the virus is a formidable enemy: even in one infected person, it swarms around the body, replicating in the key structures of the immune system, and there is no known natural cure.\'</b></i> Asked whether it was feasible to pursue an HIV vaccine in the context of funding shortages, Ndung\'u argued that we must invest in deeper understanding of the human immune system. <b><i>\'In 1935, no-one believed that a polio vaccine would work, but scientists persisted and eventually triumphed.  We are doomed as a society if we don\'t keep trying to know more.\'</b></i></p>\n\n<p>Focusing on sexual transmission of HIV as the key driver of infection, Professor Salim Abdool Karim, head of CAPRISA and President of the Medical Research Council of SA, said that over the last three years, there had been an explosion of research evidence compiled on HIV prevention using antiretroviral drugs as prophylaxis more than had been available during the first 30 years of the epidemic.  This evidence has changed the global approach to HIV prevention methods, and offered real hope for reducing levels of incidence.</p>\n\n<p>Professor Alan Whiteside of HEARD (Health Economics and AIDS Research Division) emphasised the financial burden of not curbing new HIV infections. <b><i>\'Along with the tragic spread of illness and loss, the financial challenge of treating the 12,3% of South Africa\'s population who are HIV-positive is considerable,\'</b></i> he said.</p>\n\n<p><b><i>\'The cost of drug supplies and staff will compromise the health budget in some other area. ARVs have preventative effects, but we cannot treat our way out of AIDS.  On our current health funding, we can\'t afford to follow the established guidelines for treatment. Overseas donor aid is diminishing; we can\'t increase our domestic resources, so we must spend them more efficiently.\'</b></i></p>\n\n<p>Responding to these points, audience members called for the establishment of a local drug industry that could produce medicines for a broad range of infectious and non-communicable illnesses, questioned the standards of primary health care service delivery, and raised the issue of more radical programmes for behaviour change prevention messaging.</p>\n\n<p>Abdool Karim confirmed that much can be reduced and saved through cost-effective models of care that should not compromise clinical outcomes.  <b><i>\'Right now, we are not managing our resources well and corruption eats into our supply chains,\'</b></i> he said.  <b><i>\'South Africa should be making our own ARV active ingredients this would be a rate-limiting element in the cost of drug manufacturing and supply, cut out the importation costs in foreign exchange, and create local jobs.  Necessity drives innovation, and because of the sheer need to address HIV-related problems, we\'re now doing things differently for a number of diseases such as TB, asthma, hypertension and diabetes, we have home-based and point-of-care testing, as well as task-shifting to optimise our health worker capacity.\'</b></i></p>\n\n<p>On behaviour change, Abdool Karim noted that smoking has been successfully addressed by structural driver adjustments such as raising the cost of cigarettes and prohibiting smoking in public areas, along with public education on the dangers of smoking. More studies are needed on behaviour change solutions for HIV prevention that focus on structural drivers one example being a cash incentive for staying HIV-negative.</p>\n\n<p>The panelists and audience agreed that gender violence and discrimination, particularly in relation to the vulnerability of young women to HIV infection, had to be confronted in concrete ways.</p>\n\n<p>Whiteside argued that HIV has become over-medicalised: <b><i>\'We shouldn\'t need all these drugs, because people shouldn\'t be getting infected,\'</b></i> he said. \'We need a social compact, so that people\'s right to treatment, care and support is balanced by their responsibility to respect each other, practise safe sex and adhere to treatment regimes.\'</b></i></p>\n\n<p>HIV genetic analysis and molecular evolution was presented by Professor Tulio de Oliveira, a researcher in genomics at the Wellcome Trust\'s Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies.  Using HIV genetic data and bioinformatics to examine the epidemiological patterns of HIV transmission, more can be understood about the direction of infection, which helps to guide treatment interventions. </p>\n\n<p><b><i>\'We can also study drug resistance more closely with these techniques and characterise how the disease is spreading,\'</b></i> he said. <b><i>\'This work will be of significant benefit for South Africa\'s generalised epidemic, and where rural communities are highly vulnerable.  Rather than drive more stigma into the disease by terrifying people with harsh prevention messages, we should find out more about the linkages between and characteristics of transmission agents and targets.  For instance, who is infecting young women?\'</b></i></p>\n<p>Dr Themba Moeti, CEO of Health Systems Trust, reminded the gathering that the real benefits of new discoveries accrue to patients and communities at the end of a long process of translating the findings into policy and practice. <b><i>\'Access to the interventions and services is only possible and impactful once they are taken to scale,\'</b></i>he said. <b><i>\'so, beyond the essential biomedical tools and political will needed to advance this, we need the commitment and involvement of citizens themselves.\'</b></i></p>\n\n<p><b><i>\'While the choices made by leadership have changed the path of the epidemic, people must be placed at the centre of change,\'</b></i> he said. <b><i>\'Human behaviour will determine long-term prevention and the eventual elimination of HIV as a major public health challenge.  There are many forms and aspects of the epidemic across the different types of individuals who are part of it, so social and behavioural research is crucial now.\'</b></i></p>\n\n<p>Moeti added that with the co-epidemic of HIV and TB still ranking as the highest cause of death, we must prioritise massive investment in health systems strengthening.  <b><i>\'People are living longer with HIV and will succumb to non-communicable illnesses, and we have to ensure that all these diseases can be managed efficiently.?\'</b></i> </p>\n\n<p>An audience member was concerned that despite the advances made in different scientific fields, implementation of basic prevention on the ground is still not as easy as one would suppose, citing a church-owned clinic in Lesotho that would not provide patients with male condoms.  Moeti replied that any organisation having agency to serve their constituencies pragmatically and with compassion would be morally wrong to deprive people of simple protection from disease, and that we cannot stop educating and encouraging society to practise rights-based responses for health.</p>\n\n<p>Closing the seminar, Professor Slotow noted that there had been clear recognition of the role of young, emerging researchers leading innovative responses to HIV and AIDS.  He said that the discussion had compellingly drawn the roles of science and society together:  <b><i>\'It is people with our insights, activism, behaviour and responses that will take all the science forward to create an AIDS-free future.\'</b></i>', NULL, NULL, NULL),

This was revealed at the Southern African HIV/TB drug resistance and monitoring workshop hosted by the Southern African Treatment and Resistance Network (SATuRN) at the Medical School of the University of the Free State. </p>', NULL, NULL, '<p>Prof Mark Wainberg from the McGill University AIDS Centre in Montreal, Canada, unravelled data gained from three studies (called SPRING, SINGLE and FLAMINGO) indicating that no mutations developed against dolutegravir over a period of 2 years of treatment.  Furthermore, the virus did not develop resistance against any other drugs used in combination with dolutegravir to make up the highly active trio needed to effectively treat HIV infection.  This was only seen in patients started on dolutegravir as part of first line treatment and not when used as second or third line treatment as mutations already induced by other drugs negated this effect.  A success rate of 88 to 90 % in suppressing viral replication when dolutegravir was used as first line therapy was diminished to about 63% when it was introduced after the failure of other drugs.  </p>\n<p>Prof Tulio de Oliviera from the Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies, University of KwaZulu-Natal and director of SATuRN responded: <b><i>\'It is very exciting that a drug of this potential is currently being investigated, but similar expectations were held for another group of HIV drugs, the protease inhibitors.  Not all of those were met.  We should be cautious and await more evidence.\'</b></i></p>\n<p>For two days the hallways of the medical school sizzled with heated discussions in foreign languages.  Delegates from around the globe were attracted to the 8th workshop of this kind.  HIV resistance cases, new treatment regimens, approaches to the problem of non-adherence among patients, were passionately debated and thought through.  A new feature of this workshop was its association with the largest African network on HIV drug resistance monitoring: PASER (Pan-African Studies to Evaluate Resistance), led by Prof Tobias Rinke de Wit from the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development at the Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam. Highly esteemed academics like Prof Mark Wainberg, Prof David Katzenstein from Stanford University in the USA, Prof Deenan Pillay from the University College London and the new head of the Africa Centre, Dr Catherine Orrell from the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation in Cape Town, Dr Ava Avalos from Botswana, Prof Sulaiman Akanmu from Nigeria and Prof John Frater from the Oxford University in England were among the delegates and speakers.  Uganda, Kenya, Belgium, Brazil, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Zambia, Lesotho, Swaziland and Zimbabwe added further colour to the kaleidoscope of participating countries.  Thorough discussion of patient cases from these regions allowed the more than 200 delegates to learn from one another\'s experiences, translating HIV resistance testing outcomes into better clinical care for current and future patients. </p>\n<p>The lead representative from the World Health Organisation in the area of HIV drug resistance, Dr Silvia Bertagnolio, gave an overview of the WHO strategies in this area.  South Africa has recently adopted even more ambitious guidelines in this respect, with routine drug resistance testing for all South Africans who fail 2nd line treatment.</p>\n<p>Resistance testing is an essential tool in the management of some HIV patients, but it is recognised that its added value rests upon the so called \'viral load tests\'.  These tests, already widely used in Southern Africa, give essential information regarding the ability of the drugs to prevent the virus from replicating.  Low viral load means few viruses detected in the blood stream.  This implies the drugs are working and the virus is not resistant to them (yet).  Of the utmost importance is that a high viral load must be recognised as a possible emergency.  The action required upon this high viral load is an intensive effort of several months to motivate the patient to take the HIV drugs each and every day.  A subsequent follow up viral load is then done and if still high it means the drugs have stopped working; the virus might be resistant and replicating freely.  A decision must then be taken to either change the patient to a new regimen or send the patient for a drug resistant test to help decide which regimen to prescribe next.</p>\n<p>The workshop was preceded by a joint meeting of the PASER and SATURN networks, which are working towards increased collaboration.  New projects and progress reports on existing ones were scrutinized and technical information related to HIV drug resistance testing was shared.  The clinical implications of laboratory work were teased from the data and applied to resistance programs in the Southern African region.</p>\n<p>Sponsors invested in this excellent workshop which will positively impact on the clinical ability and knowledge of all participants and ultimately on the care of HIV patients.  The sponsors include the CDC (Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention, USA), the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Pretoria, the Wellcome Trust, the European Union, PASER, the Africa Centre and the University of the Free State.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>###</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>About SATURN</p>\n<p>SATuRN includes 24 research partners in southern Africa.

The course attracted over 35 applicants but due to space limitations, 25 participants from several African countries including Uganda, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Sudan were invited to attend. Eight (8) course teachers from Uganda, South Africa, the United States of America and the United Kingdom facilitated at the course.</p>\n<p>The four-day workshop involved theoretical lectures and practical sessions on the usage and interpretation of bioinformatics applications for the study of small and large data sets of HIV and other genomic data. Softwares used in the practical sessions include PHYLIP, PAUP*, PHYML, MEGA, TREE-PUZZLE, BEAST, Simplot, MrBayes, RegaDB and other software. This workshop also included statistical analysis of HIV drug resistance and phylogenetic inference and interpretation of phylogenetic trees.</p>\n\n<p>The first day of the workshop had a lecture on the general introduction to phylogenetics and its biological applications, which set the ground for the course. The course took the students through the various sequencing technologies, denovo sequence assembly and quality control. The students were taken through the theory and practical sessions on sequence alignments.</p>\n\n<p>On the second day, more practical sessions on multiple sequence alignments were held. This was followed by lectures and practical sessions on the easy maths of trees, the basic principles of building and interpreting trees. A keynote presentation open to the UVRI community on the Molecular Epidemiology of HIV-1 in concentrated Epidemics was done. Students were later through a practical session on phylogenetic graphics using the Cluster Picker software.</p>\n\n<p>The third day involved lectures on the various substitution models, JModel test and a practical on Maximum Likelihood using PhyML. A second keynote lecture open to the UVRI community on exploring epidemic structure in HIV and influenza using phylodynamics was made. This was followed by a practical session on Bayesian inference using the BEAST software.</p>\n\n<p>The fourth and final day had a theory and practical session on detecting recombination using the various available free online and commercial softwares. Students were later taken through the processes of generating and analyzing HIV drug resistance data. The various drug resistance databases were also explored during this session. Students at the workshop were also encouraged to utilize their own sequence data with the help of the teachers. The course was concluded with a certificate award to the students and a workshop barbeque. </p>\n\n<p>The course feedback was very encouraging with useful suggestions on how best to improve future courses.

The pace of change means that the more closely two isolates resemble each other, the more recently they shared a common host\' making it possible to track the spread of the virus and design precise interventions to block it. Last week at the New York Academy of Sciences in New York City, researchers, public health specialists, and HIV/AIDS advocates discussed how to exploit the potential of the technique, called phylogenetic analysis\'and the thorny ethical and legal issues it raises.</p>\n<p><b><i>\'This is a methodological breakthrough,\'</b></i> says epidemiologist William Blattner of the University of Maryland School of Medicine\'s Institute of Human Virology in Baltimore. The plummeting costs of DNA and RNA sequencing are now allowing it to be applied on a large scale, and early efforts are yielding some surprises about how HIV spreads and when it can most effectively be controlled.</p>\n<p>At the heart of the technique is the assumption that if the HIV sequences found in two people differ by less than 1.5%, then they are in a <b><i>\'transmission cluster.\'</b></i> This does not prove that one person infected the other\'there could have been intermediaries but their infections are closely linked. Because HIV mutates at a constant rate, researchers can also construct a molecular clock to estimate when the transmission took place. Combining the information from many HIV-infected people in a limited geographical area creates diagrams that resemble airline routing maps, allowing researchers to infer the direction and speed of spread.</p>\n<p>One study, by a group led by epidemiologist Alexa Oster of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, takes advantage of a CDC recommendation that before starting antiretroviral (ARV) treatment, every newly infected person be tested for drug-resistant virus. That requires sequencing HIV, which has enabled CDC to build an anonymized database that includes information such as likely mode of transmission and age.</p>\n<p>With researchers from the University of California, San Diego, Oster\'s team mined HIV sequences from 27 sites around the country. They found that in men who report having sex with men (MSM), that explains the transmission 88% of the time. But surprisingly, Oster said, among men and women who inject drugs, the most common source of infection is not needle sharing but sex involving MSM. Also unexpected: Infections in heterosexual women were more frequently linked to MSM than to heterosexual men.</p>\n<p>CDC is now tracking transmission networks of 30 or more people to project whether they will grow by 2020. <b><i>\'If we were able to predict which clusters are going to grow, we would know where we might want to focus prevention efforts,\'</b></i> Oster said.</p>\n<p>Christophe Fraser, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, and his colleagues hope to bolster prevention efforts in the Netherlands with their analysis of more than 13,000 HIV sequences from a cohort of predominantly MSM. They identified 106 distinct transmission networks and 883 probable transmitters, 69.2% of whom had undiagnosed infections; diagnosed people on ARV treatment, in contrast, rarely transmitted. What\'s more, 40% of the probable transmitters had just recently become infected, a time when they are most infectious. Models suggest that treating high-risk people who test negative for HIV with ARVs, a strategy called preexposure prophylaxis, could lead to <b><i>\'substantial reductions in transmission\'</b></i> in the Netherlands, Fraser said.</p>\n<p>An ambitious new consortium, the Phylogenetics and Networks for Generalised HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA_HIV), plans to sequence 20,000 full HIV genomes from people who are already participating in other research studies in four subSaharan countries. PANGEA_HIV aims to see whether phylogenetics can accurately assess new infection rates. That, in turn, could reveal whether a prevention intervention worked. <b><i>\'If you can use genetic data to see the effect of interventions, it may be much cheaper\'</b></i> than the current method of following an uninfected cohort over time, said PANGEA_HIV collaborator <b><i><a href=\"people.php\'peopleid=1\">Tulio de Oliveira</b></i></a>, a bioinformatics specialist at the Wellcome Trust Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies in Mtubatuba, South Africa.</p>\n<p>Speakers stressed the limits of phylogenetic analyses and cautioned that data could potentially be misused.

Viral sequence data is a major asset in the characterization of pathogens. Understanding the processes that generate genetic diversity assists in the struggle against viral infections and enhances our understanding of past evolutionary and epidemiological events.  It can also help in the identification of the origins of new epidemics, in monitoring the effectiveness of therapeutic strategies, and eventually in predicting the behavior of viral epidemics. Advances in bioinformatics have led to improved approaches to investigating viral outbreaks that ave been successfully applied to viruses including the Human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), the Ebola virus, the Dengue viruses, the Chikungunya virus and the Influenza virus.</p>\n\n\n', NULL, NULL, 'Y'),

In most places in the country, where clinics are overtaxed, this would presage a wait of up to 10 hours. But here something different is happening. Staffers at computer monitors swiftly log in people and dispatch them for triage or, if they have tuberculosis, a special area away from others. Those who only need their antiretroviral (ARV) drugs walk directly to the pharmacists, who retrieve each patient\'s electronic medical record and use a robotic system to pull drugs from shelves and fill orders. The average wait time is 30 minutes to 2 hours to complete a doctor or nurse visit and 15 minutes at the pharmacy. A prototype ATM promises to further speed visits by directly dispensing ARV pills; one day, it is hoped, similar pill machines in shopping malls could make some clinic visits unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p><center><img src=\"imagesBIO/imagescience.jpg\"></center></p>\n\n<p>\'This is an awesomely efficient place,\' says Ian Sanne, who heads Right to Care, a nongovernmental organization that runs this and several other clinics in collaboration with the health department. In developed countries, where patients complain about much shorter waits, this boast might seem absurd. But in South Africa, the Themba Lethu Clinic is celebrated as an example of what can be done to care for large numbers of HIV-infected people. This is at once a compliment to the clinic and a hint of the country\'s overwhelming HIV/AIDS challenge.</p>\n\n<p>South Africa has pledged to ramp up efforts to end its massive HIV/AIDS epidemic, the world\'s largest. Come September, it will offer every infected person ARVs, which both stave off disease and make people less infectious. The immediate goal is to reach what is known as 90-90-90 by 2020: to have 90% of infected people aware of their status, 90% of known positives start ARVs, and 90% of that group drive the amount of virus in their bloodstream down to un-detectable levels. The theory is that as viral levels drop, transmission will, too, leading the epidemic to spiral downward. This 90-90-90 target is the cornerstone of a grand campaign, articulated by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and widely embraced by world leaders, to end the AIDS epidemic \'as a global public health threat\' by 2030. </p>\n\n<p>In a nation estimated to have at least 6.6 million HIV-infected people\'18% of the world\'s total\'the drive to hit 90-90-90 by 2020 seems overly ambitious to many experts. And the obstacles faced by South Africa provide a sobering reality check to the lofty, laudable aspiration of ending AIDS, a topic that promises to occupy center stage later this month in Durban at the biannual International AIDS Conference.</p>\n\n<p>Models and reality</p>\n\n<p>A model predicts how different HIV/AIDS response scenarios would affect new infection rates, or incidence. As seen on the map, some areas of the country have far more HIV than others.</p>\n\n<p><center><img src=\"imagesBIO/AIDS_map.png\"></center></p>\n<p>South African HIV and TB Investment Case, SANAC and National Department of Health</p>\n\n<p>South Africa has already made enormous gains against its HIV/AIDS epidemic. When it last hosted this international gathering in 2000, then-President Thabo Mbeki and his health minister questioned whether HIV even causes AIDS, triggering widespread outrage. At the time, only the wealthiest South Africans had access to ARVs, which cost about $5000 per person for an annual supply. But by the end of 2015, the price had dropped to $100, and 3.4 million HIV-infected South Africans were receiving ARVs\'more than in any other country in the world. South Africa, in fact, consumes the same amount of the life-saving drugs as Asia and the Pacific, North America, and western and central Europe combined. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, life expectancy jumped 9 years between 2005, when ARVs started to become widely available, and 2014. The country has pioneered innovative ways to deliver the drugs and help people stay on them. And South Africa\'s strong cadre of HIV/AIDS investigators has made the country a hub of cutting-edge basic research and clinical trials. \'Given our resources, we\'ve done amazing things,\' says Glenda Gray, an HIV/AIDS researcher who heads South Africa\'s Medical Research Council in Cape Town.</p>\n\n<p>This family tree is derived from the DNA of thousands of HIV isolates from South Africa and it shows how the virus has evolved in 5 year periods. The darkest blue dots represent sequences from 2010-15 and the lightest dots are from 1989.</p>\n\n<p>This family tree is derived from the genetic material of thousands of HIV isolates from South Africa and it shows how the virus has evolved in 5-year periods.

Some have not suffered enough immune damage from the virus to merit ARVs under current government policy. Many other infected people don\'t know their status or never seek care, and still others who start treatment have difficulty taking their daily pills for years on end. Estimates suggest that because of failures in this \'care continuum,\' only about one in four HIV-infected South Africans has fully suppressed the virus. \'We have to ride two horses at the same time,\' says Fareed Abdullah, who heads the quasi-governmental South African National AIDS Council (SANAC) in Pretoria. \'One is to improve our system so that the more than 3 million on treatment are retained in care and properly managed, and we also have to expand to a group that is largely asymptomatic and well.\'</p>\n<p>Adding to those challenges is South Africa\'s alarming HIV incidence\'the percentage of the population that becomes infected each year. The government reports that HIV incidence has dropped from a high of 1.67% in adults in 2005 to 1.22% last year, but that still translates into 330,000 new infections a year. The rate is shockingly high in women under 25, especially in the hardest hit province, KwaZulu-Natal, where incidence tops 6% in some communities.</p>\n\n<p>Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, who acknowledges that the country\'s aggressive HIV/AIDS program got off to a late start because of Mbeki, is confident that South Africa has the willpower and the money to hit 90-90-90. \'Can we afford not to treat people\'\' Motsoaledi asks. \'Surely, we\'re going to pay much more dearly socially, politically, and economically if you can\'t.\' To that end, the government, which already spends $1.2 billion a year on HIV/AIDS and receives another $300 million in foreign aid, is adding $65 million annually through 2019.</p>\n\n<p>But a new report concludes that meeting the UNAIDS target will require an additional $8 billion over the next 5 years. \'UNAIDS is pushing very hard on our health ministry, which doesn\'t want to be caughtshort again and wants to make the case that we can reach 90-90-90,\' says Linda-Gail Bekker, who co-runs the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation (DTHF) in Cape Town and is one of the co-authors of the report. The cost of drugs is just one part of the equation, she says. Reaching the target will also require massive HIV testing and the costly delivery of ARVs to patients who must be monitored and then helped if they\'re not suppressing the virus. \'I\'m really, really anxious about the resources it\'s going to take.\' </p>\n<p>There are scientific questions, too. The assumption that reaching the 90-90-90 target will end AIDS is based on mathematical models that factor in ARV \'coverage\' in combination with other proven prevention strategies like male circumcision, condom promotion, and behavior change efforts. Researchers note that in large epidemics like the one in South Africa, which has spread far beyond \'concentrated\' populations such as men who have sex with men and sex workers, such strategies could prove less effective than expected, allowing HIV to continue spreading at high rates even after the country reaches 90-90-90.</p>\n\n<p>Epidemiologist Salim Abdool Karim, who runs the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) in Durban, points to recent data from Botswana that call into question the model\'s assumptions. Botswana, which is relatively wealthy and has a tiny population of 2 million, has nearly reached 90-90-90, as shown in a study published online on 23 March in The Lancet. But incidence has barely budged, in part because the missing 10-10-10 continue to spread the virus. \'For a country that\'s close to 90-90-90, the incidence is ridiculously high,\' Karim says. \'It\'s scandalous.\' A report published by SANAC and the health department further questions the 90-90-90 mathematical modeling. Even if 90-90-90 leads to big declines in new infections by 2030, that report suggests that incidence in South Africa\'s population of 53 million will not quite drop below 0.1%\'the level that UNAIDS says it must reach for an epidemic to end. </p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is that it remains an open question whether the 90-90-90 treatment goal really can stop the spread of HIV in South Africa. Some of the world\'s largest controlled trials of treatment as prevention (TasP) are underway in the country to try to answer it.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is that it remains an open question whether the 90-90-90 treatment goal really can stop the spread of HIV in South Africa. Some of the world\'s largest controlled trials of treatment as prevention (TasP) are underway in the country to try to answer it.</p>\n\n<p>In an area known as Mfekayi in rural KwaZulu-Natal, two dozen people are sitting on the shaded porch of a plywood shack waiting their turn to see a counselor. The shack is the Egedeni Clinic, and the people are participants in a 28,000-person, multisite clinical trial that will assess the precise relationship between increased levels of HIV suppression in a community and drops in incidence. At Egedeni and 10 other clinics across the province, the TasP study offers ARVs to all infected participants. Another 11 TasP clinics instead offer treatment in keeping with current government recommendations, meaning that people start ARVs only after their immune systems show signs of damage.</p>\n\n<p>One by one, the participants hand bottles of ARVs they received a month earlier to the counselors, who count the remaining pills. This ritual, which is a crude way to monitor adherence, underscores an obvious limitation of the underlying strategy: Even if ARVs make people less infectious, TasP relies on the fickle relationship humans have with taking daily medications. </p>\n\n<p>Run by the Africa Centre for Population Health in nearby Mtubatuba, TasP is the furthest along of four similar large trials in sub-Saharan Africa that are examining the care continuum and the real-world outcome of \'universal treatment.\' Early analysis of TasP results found that fewer than 40% of the people who tested positive sought care within 3 months, as recommended. This first step still has remained a major stumbling block on the road to 90-90-90.</p>\n\n<p>At the International AIDS Conference later this month, the researchers plan to reveal whether their intervention has reduced incidence. \'This will be the first opportunity to assess whether, in fact, the bio-logical rationale is actually true in practice,\' says Deenan Pillay, a clinical virologist who heads the Africa Centre. But Pillay says the study already has made clear that ending AIDS is not simply a matter of \'let\'s just treat everyone and everything will be OK.\' In the final analysis, he says, the power of TasP depends as much on human behavior as it does on biology.</p>\n\n<p>Jacqualine Ncube, a 19-year-old restaurant worker, first took an HIV test when she was in high school. At the time, Ncube spent many hours after school hanging out at DTHF\'s Youth Centre, which abuts the struggling township of Masiphumelele outside of Cape Town. The Youth Centre offers teens internet access, holds soccer matches, loans surfboards, and provides care at a health clinic. Kids also earn \'Tutus,\' good for shopping vouchers or food, for every-thing from helping the community to taking an HIV test. When Ncube got her first results, she was overwhelmed. \'I really screamed,\' she says. She was negative.  </p>\n\n<p>Ncube has repeatedly tested negative, and in April 2015 she joined the Youth Centre\'s Pillsplus, a study of what\'s known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, in 150 teens. With PrEP, uninfected people take daily ARV pills to prevent infection. Although PrEP is a proven strategy, South Africa recommends its use only in sex workers, and Ncube is one of the first hetero-sexual teens in the world to take ARVs for prevention. She still uses condoms with her boyfriend, but says she wanted to try PrEP because \'no protection is 100%.\'</p>\n\n<p>DTHF\'s Bekker, who is heading Pillsplus to assess PrEP\'s acceptability in teens, contends that PrEP should be provided to all people at high risk of infection. \'When I sit opposite a 17-year-old young woman, I have nothing to offer her,\' Bekker says. </p>\n\n<p>CAPRISA\'s Karim says using PrEP in young women could be key to breaking the epidemic\'s back. About 30% of new infections in South Africa occur in young women between 15 and 24 years of age. The new infection rate in men in the same age bracket is more than four times lower. In some districts of KwaZulu-Natal, a woman has a 60% chance of becoming infected by age 34.</p>\n\n<p>Sex and age</p>\n\n<p>HIV infects far more girls and young women than boys and men of the same age in South Africa. The sex difference shrinks by age 35, then prevalence drops.</p>\n\n<p><center><img src=\"imagesBIO/AIDS_prevalence_0.png\"></center></p>\n<p><center><img src=\"imagesBIO/AIDS_cycle_0.png\"></center></p>\n\n<p>To understand the pattern of viral spread, CAPRISA and the Africa Centre mapped out the infection cycle between men and women of different ages in KwaZulu-Natal. The study analyzed the genetic sequences of HIV isolated from 858 men and women, all between 16 and 35 years old, who belonged to the same sexual networks. The viral genetics linked different isolates and indicated which ones were older, allowing the researchers to infer who infected whom. Teenage girls were infected by men who were, on average, 8 years older. After the age of 24, people typically became infected by partners their own age, with transmission more frequently moving from woman to man. \'They are trying to find lifetime partners at this age,\' Karim says. These older men are the same group having sex with the youngest women. \'We have to break the chain between men in their late 20s and teen girls,\' he says. </p>\n\n<p>PrEP can help address shortcomings of TasP, Karim says. In the infection-cycle study, men who infected younger women had extremely high HIV levels, indicating they recently acquired the virus and thus would not appear infected on standard antibody-based tests. \'If your strategy is to test and treat these people, you\'re not going to catch them,\' Karim says. Men are also less connected to the health care system and often migrate for work, he adds, making it more difficult to help those who know they are infected fully suppress the virus. Giving PrEP to young women sidesteps the male dilemma. \'We just have to protect girls for 5 years in that critical risk period until they find their partners,\' he says.</p>\n\n<p>Karim says new biomedical interventions on the horizon may bolster prevention efforts. His group plans to report at the Durban meeting that it has identified an unusual microbe linked to vaginal inflammation in women in KwaZulu-Natal. Treating it could potentially lower their risk of HIV infection. Injectable ARVs that last for 2 months are also being tested in South Africa and elsewhere, and those could eliminate the challenge of taking daily pills\'a key problem for both treatment and PrEP. Next fall, South Africa plans to launch the world\'s only efficacy trial of an AIDS vaccine\'the strongest preventive medicine of all.</p>\n\n<p>For now, 90-90-90 is the most powerful tool available to South Africa in its quest to end its epidemic, even if PrEP and other new strategies ultimately are needed. SANAC\'s Abdullah takes a pragmatic view of meeting the UNAIDS deadline. \'I think we should plan for it, because if we don\'t hit it by 2020, we\'ll do it by 2022,\' he predicts. \'What we\'re really after is bringing down new infections to low levels,\' along with getting as many HIV-infected people as possible on treatment and living longer lives. The virus itself, Abdullah says, \'will be with us for the next 100 years.\'</p>\n', NULL, NULL, 'Y');

Lancet HIV 2016)</a>. The paper was presented as a Keynote at AIDS 2016 conference.</p>\n', NULL, NULL, '<p><center><img src=\"imagesBIO/NatureGeneticsHIV.jpg\"></center></p>\n<p>By Amy Maxem, Nature, Vol 535, page 335, 21 July 2016</p>\n<p>Sex between young women and older men is no secret in South Africa. The name \'blesser\' is commonly used to describe a man who may at first pay for a teenager\'s bus fare to high school, then buy school supplies she cannot afford, and perhaps lunch at a decent cafe. Over time, the adolescent sleeps with her provider.</p>\n<p>A genetic analysis, lead by Prof. Tulio de Oliveira, now suggests how this social phenomenon plays into the cycle of HIV transmission in the country, which has the world\'s largest HIV epidemic. By analysing the similarity of viral genetic sequences from nearly 1,600 people with HIV in one community in KwaZulu-Natal, the study shows that adolescent girls and women in their early 20s tend to pick up the virus from men aged around 30. When the women grow older, they go on to infect their long-term partners, who in turn may pass the virus on through affairs with younger women.</p>\n<p><b><i>This is the engine driving high rates of HIV,</b></i> says epidemiologist Salim Abdool Karim, senior author of the unpublished study and director of the Centre for the AIDS</p>\n<p>Program of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA). He presents the work this week at the International AIDS Conference in Durban.</p>\n<p>Karim thinks that the study adds to growing evidence that HIV-free young women in regions with very high rates of HIV should be encouraged to take antiretroviral medications regularly to prevent infection. The World Health Organization also recommends that people at substantial risk of HIV be offered what is known as PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis). But, owing in part to disappointing results in clinical trials, the South African government has not yet recommended PrEP for young women.</p>\n<p>Karim\'s study also shows the importance of making broader social changes, adds <b><i>Michel Sidibe, executive director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)</b></i>. In parts of South Africa, 8 times as many teenage girls have HIV as do teenage boys, and in some communities in KwaZulu-Natal, a 15-year-old girl has an 80% risk of getting HIV in her lifetime.\' <b><i>Something that underlies the study is how common it is for older men to have sex with young girls. Pills are useful, but how can we break this silence around the lack of enforcement of laws that protect young women\' How can we invest in the capacity of people to claim their rights and reduce this kind of violence\'\'</b></i></p>\n<p><b><i>VICIOUS CYCLE</b></i></p>\n<b><i>\'This is the engine driving high rates of HIV.\'</b></i>\n<p>Researchers have long known of the high burden of HIV infections in young South African women, and that they get infected by older men, says <b><i>Thomas Quinn, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</b></i>  in Baltimore, Maryland, who was not involved in the study. But, he says, <b><i>\'it is very exciting to use molecular genetic information to actually show how the virus spreads among people\'</b></i>  \' and to pinpoint the ages of women and men at key points in the cycle of HIV transmission.</p>\n<p>Karim has tracked HIV genetic data for the past couple of years, and his work has already affected how governments and international organizations tackle the virus. He has been sharing results regularly with Deborah Birx, the US Global AIDS Coordinator who oversees the US President\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the largest federal funder of HIV-prevention research.</p>\n<p>In 2014, PEPFAR launched an initiative called DREAMS to protect young women from HIV, in response to the finding that more than 1,000 women aged 16\'24 become infected every day in southern and eastern Africa. When Birx heard details of Karim\'s results last year, she convinced PEPFAR to target particular demographic groups. For example, she says, half of the recipients of the US$85-million DREAMS Innovation Challenge, announced on 18 July, are 15- to 19-year-old girls.</p>\n<p>Despite the results, health officials remain reluctant to recommend PrEP for adolescent girls and young women. In June, the South African government endorsed PrEP for sex workers \' but not for other high-risk groups, such as gay men and young women. One reason for its hesitancy is that the treatments have not proved effective in clinical trials, and blood tests have suggested that is because women in these trials did not consistently take their medications (either daily pills or a vaginal gel).</p>\n<p>But at the conference, the CAPRISA team announced another as-yet-unpublished finding that suggests a woman\'s vaginal microbiome may be in part responsible for the inefficacy of PrEP. A study of women who used the gel tenofovir to prevent HIV infection suggests that it was less effective in those who had Gardnerella vaginalis bacteria in their vaginal lining. The researchers found that G. vaginalis absorbed the PrEP drugs, reducing the amount of medication in the blood.</p>\n<p>This hints that more women may actually have taken their medications than the disappointing blood tests from earlier trials suggested, Karim says \' and also that treatment for an imbalance in vaginal bacteria might help PrEP to work better in some young women.</p>', NULL, NULL, 'Y'),

By June 2016, around 18.2 million [16.1 million 19.0 million] people had access to the life-saving medicines, including 910 000 children, double the number five years earlier. If these efforts are sustained and increased, the world will be on track to achieve the target of 30 million people on treatment by 2020.</p>\n<p>Get on the Fast-Track: the life-cycle approach to HIV was launched today in Windhoek, Namibia, by the President of Namibia, Hage Geingob and the Executive Director of UNAIDS, Michel Sidibe.  <b><i>\'Just under two years ago, 15 million people were accessing antiretroviral treatment today more than 18 million are on treatment and new HIV infections among children continue to fall,\'</b></i> said President Geingob. <b><i>\'Now, we must ensure that the world stays on the Fast-Track to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030 in Namibia, in Africa and across the world.\'</b></i>  </p>\n<p>The report contains detailed data on the complexities of HIV and reveals that girls  transition to womanhood is a very dangerous time, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. <b><i>\'Young women are facing a triple threat,\'</b></i> said Mr Sidibe. <b><i>\'They are at high risk of HIV infection, have low rates of HIV testing, and have poor adherence to treatment. The world is failing young women and we urgently need to do more.\'</b></i></p>\n<p>HIV prevention is key to ending the AIDS epidemic among young women and the cycle of HIV infection needs to be broken. Recent data from South-Africa shows that young women are acquiring HIV from adult men, while men acquire HIV much later in life after they transition into adulthood and continue the cycle of new infections.  </p>\n<p>The report also shows that the life-extending impact of treatment is working. In 2015, there were more people over the age of 50 living with HIV than ever before 5.8 million. The report highlights that if treatment targets are reached, that number is expected to soar to 8.5 million by 2020. Older people living with HIV, however, have up to five times the risk of chronic disease and a comprehensive strategy is needed to respond to increasing long-term health-care costs.    </p>\n<p>The report also warns of the risk of drug resistance and the need to reduce the costs of second- and third-line treatments. It also highlights the need for more synergies with tuberculosis (TB), human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer, and hepatitis C programmes in order to reduce the major causes of illness and death among people living with HIV. In 2015, 440 000 of the 1.1 million people who died from an AIDS-related illness died from TB, including 40 000 children.</p>\n<p><b><i>\'The progress we have made is remarkable, particularly around treatment, but it is also incredibly fragile,\'</b></i> said Mr Sidibe. <b><i>\'New threats are emerging and if we do not act now we risk resurgence and resistance. We have seen this with TB. We must not make the same mistakes again.\'</b></i></p>\n<p>Get on the Fast-Track: the life-cycle approach to HIV outlines that large numbers of people at higher-risk of HIV infection and people living in high-burden areas are being left without access to HIV services at critical points in their lives, opening the door to new HIV infections and increasing the risk of dying from AIDS-related illnesses. The report examines the gaps and approaches needed in HIV programming across the life cycle and offers tailored HIV prevention and treatment solutions for every stage of life.</p>\n<p>\"Ending AIDS is possible only if we join hands by each doing what is within our scope, creatively and aggressively embracing the 90 90 90 targets,\" said Eunice Makena Henguva, Youth Economic Empowerment Project Officer for the Namibian Women\'s Health Network.</p>\n<p><b><i>From birth</b></i></p>\n<p>Globally, access to HIV medicines to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV has increased to 77% in 2015 (up from 50% in 2010). As a result, new HIV infections among children have declined by 51% since 2010.</p>\n<p>The report highlights that of the 150 000 children who were newly infected with HIV in 2015, around half were infected through breastfeeding. It stresses that infection through breastfeeding can be avoided if mothers living with HIV are supported to continue taking antiretroviral medicines, allowing them to breastfeed safely and ensure that their children receive the important protective benefits of breastmilk.</p>\n<p>Testing also remains a major issue. The report shows that only four of 21 priority countries in Africa provided HIV testing for more than half the babies exposed to HIV within their first weeks of life. It also shows that in Nigeria, which accounts for more than a quarter of all new HIV infections among children globally, only half of pregnant women living with HIV are tested for HIV.</p>\n<p>Get on the Fast-Track: the life-cycle approach to HIV stresses that more efforts are needed to expand HIV testing for pregnant women, expand treatment for children and improve and expand early infant diagnosis by using new diagnostic tools and innovative methods, such as SMS reminders, to retain mothers living with HIV and their babies in care.</p>\n<p>The report also encourages countries to adopt the targets of the Start Free, Stay Free, AIDS Free framework led by UNAIDS and the United States President s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to reduce the number of new HIV infections among children, adolescents and young women, and ensure lifelong access to antiretroviral therapy if they are living with HIV.</p>\n<p><b><i>Through adolescence</b></i></p>\n<p>The report shows that the ages between 15 and 24 years are an incredibly dangerous time for young women. In 2015, around 7500 young women became newly infected with HIV every week. Data from studies in six locations within eastern and southern Africa reveal that in southern Africa girls aged between 15 and 19 years accounted for 90% of all new HIV infections among 10 19-year-olds, and more than 74% in eastern Africa. </p>\n<p>Globally, between 2010 and 2015, the number of new HIV infections among young women aged between 15 and 24 years was reduced by just 6%, from 420 000 to 390 000. To reach the target of less than 100 000 new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women by 2020 will require a 74% reduction in the four years between 2016 and 2020.</p>\n<p>Many children who were born with HIV and survived are now entering adulthood. Studies from 25 countries in 2015 show that 40% of young people aged between 15 and 19 years became infected through mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This transition is also magnifying another major challenge high numbers of AIDS-related deaths among adolescents. Adolescents living with HIV have the highest rates of poor medication adherence and treatment failure.</p>\n<p>A range of solutions are needed to respond to the specific needs of adolescents, including increased HIV prevention efforts, keeping girls and boys in school, increasing HIV testing and voluntary medical male circumcision, pre-exposure prophylaxis and immediate access to antiretroviral therapy.   </p>\n<p><b><i>Key populations</b></i></p>\n<p>In 2014, an estimated 45% of all new HIV infections globally were among members of key populations and their sexual partners. The report warns that new HIV infections are continuing to rise among people who inject drugs (by 36% from 2010 to 2015) and among gay men and other men who have sex with men (by 12% from 2010 to 2015) and are not declining among sex workers or transgender people.</p>\n<p>The report outlines the critical need to reach key populations with HIV prevention and treatment programmes that meet their specific needs throughout their lives; however, total funding levels are far below what is needed for HIV programmes to reach key populations, particularly funding from domestic sources.</p>\n<p><b><i>Adulthood</b></i></p>\n<p>In July 2016, in the HIV prevention gap report, UNAIDS warned that HIV prevention efforts are not working for adults and that new HIV infections among adults have failed to decline for at least five years. Get on the Fast-Track: the life-cycle approach to HIV cites concerns that western and central Africa is off-track in responding to HIV. The region accounts for 18% of people living with HIV, but a serious lack of access to treatment means that the region accounts for 30% of all AIDS-related deaths globally. </p>\n<p>The report sheds new light on HIV infection and treatment among adult men, showing that men are much less likely to know their HIV status and access treatment than women. One study in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, showed that just 26% of men were aware of their HIV status, only 5% were on treatment and that the viral load among men living with HIV was extremely high, making onward transmission of the virus much more likely.</p>\n<p><b><i>Into later life</b></i></p>\n<p>The report shows that antiretroviral therapy is allowing people living with HIV to live longer. In 2015, people more than 50 years old accounted for around 17% of the adult population (15 years and older) living with HIV. In high-income countries, 31% of people living with HIV were over the age of 50 years.</p>\n<p>Get on the Fast-Track: the life-cycle approach also shows that around 100 000 people in low- and middle-income countries aged 50 years and over are estimated to newly acquire HIV every year, confirming the need to include older people in HIV prevention, as well as treatment, programming.</p>\n<p>As people living with HIV grow older, they are also at risk of developing long-term side-effects from HIV treatment, developing drug resistance and requiring treatment of co-morbidities, such as TB and hepatitis C, which can also interact with antiretroviral therapy. Continued research and investment is needed to discover simpler, more tolerable treatments for HIV and co-morbidities and to discover an HIV vaccine and cure.</p>\n<p>Finding solutions for everyone at every stage of life</p>\n<p>The report concludes that investments must be made wisely across the life cycle, using a location population approach to ensure that evidence-informed, high-impact programmes are available in the geographical areas and among the populations in greatest need.</p>\n<p>It strongly urges countries to continue to Fast-Track HIV prevention, testing and treatment in order to end the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030 and ensure that future generations are free from HIV.</p>\n<p>New phylogenetic data from South Africa (de Oliveira et al. Lancet HIV 2016) reveal a vicious cycle of HIV infection among older and younger people that may be at play in many high-prevalence settings: young women are acquiring HIV from adult men\'as these young women grow older, they tend to transmit HIV to adult men, and the cycle repeats. Data from other studies suggest that gender inequalities and harmful masculinities underpin this cycle. Lower access to education, lower levels of economic independence and intimate partner violence erode the ability of young women to negotiate safer sex and retain control of their bodies. Men, meanwhile, tend to be ignored by health policies and HIV strategies, they seek services infrequently, and they tend to be diagnosed with HIV and initiate treatment very late - often with deadly consequences.</p>\n\n', 'UNAIDS, report 2016, phylogenetic, de oliveira, young woman, transmission, cycle of infection, CAPRISA, South Africa, UNAIDS, report 2016, phylogenetic, de oliveira, young woman, transmission, cycle of infection, CAPRISA, South Africa, UNAIDS, report 2016, phylogenetic, de oliveira, young woman, transmission, cycle of infection, CAPRISA, South Africa, UNAIDS, report 2016, phylogenetic, de oliveira, young woman, transmission, cycle of infection, CAPRISA, South Africa, UNAIDS, report 2016, phylogenetic, de oliveira, young woman, transmission, cycle of infection, CAPRISA, South Africa', 'UNAIDS 2016 report show that our new phylogenetic data from South Africa reveal a vicious cycle of HIV infection among older and younger people that may be at play in many high-prevalence settings: young women are acquiring HIV from adult men?as these young women grow older, they tend to transmit HIV to adult men, and the cycle repeats', 'Y'),

Nearly three quarters of new HIV infections in adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa are in females.

The analysis found that a vaginal ring that continuously releases the HIV drug dapivirine reduced the risk of HIV infection in women by at least 56%.</p>\n<p>In one study of a South African community, the CAPRISA researchers analyzed the genetic code of HIV from each of 1,589 HIV-positive people, tracing an unrelenting cycle of HIV transmission in which women under the age of 25 are routinely infected by men who are on average 8.7 years older than they are. The researchers found that girls between ages 16 and 20 are infected by men 11.5 years older than they are. <a href=\"http://www.bioafrica.net/publications.php?pubid=139\">Open access publication (de Oliveira et al. Lancet HIV 2016)</a> </p>\n<p>The men in turn are infected by women their own age?many of whom were given the virus by older men when they were younger. Nearly 62% of women in the study ages 25 to 40 were HIV positive. <b><i>\'This cycle is the engine that ensures you have continuing high rates of HIV,\'</b></i> Dr. Abdool Karim said.</p>\n<p>The researchers then showed how an abundance of certain bacteria in the vagina put women at greater risk of HIV infection and make a preventive drug less effective. Analyzing more than 3 million genetic sequences from 120 South African women, the CAPRISA researchers found that those with large amounts of a particular bacterium, Prevotella bivia, had a 19.2 times greater chance of inflammation and HIV infection than those who had low levels or none of this bacteria. The bacteria may release a molecule linked to HIV infection, the researchers found.</p>\n<p>The CAPRISA researchers then analyzed genital bacterial proteins in 688 women. They discovered that a microbicide?a compound to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections?containing the drug tenofovir was effective in the 61% of women who had predominantly <b><i>\'healthy\'</b></i> bacteria in their vaginas. But it had little effect in the remaining women, who had large amounts of gardnerella bacteria. The bacteria absorbed much of the drug, rather than leaving it to fight off HIV.</p>\n<p>The findings provide evidence that young women should be tested regularly for bacterial infections and treated if they have them, Dr. Abdool Karim said. They should also be offered HIV drugs for pre-exposure prophylaxis, or known as PrEP, to prevent infection, he said.</p>\n<p><b><i>\'PrEP is not promoted in this younger population and this series should make people rethink whether it should be offered to them,\'</b></i> said Thomas Quinn, an HIV/AIDS expert at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, who was briefed on, but not involved in, the research. <b><i>\'These young women have superhigh infection rates.\'</b></i></p>\n<p>He called the research <b><i>\'a nice blending of behavioral with biological sciences.\'</b></i></p>\n<p>The research is particularly important because sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing a boom in its youth population, as mortality rates have dropped, according to Deborah Birx, the U.S. global AIDS coordinator. It also helps to explain why microbicides have appeared in studies to be less effective among young women than other age groups, said Dr. Birx, describing the work as <b><i>\'groundbreaking.\'</b></i></p>\n<p>Scientists had concluded that the women weren?t using the microbicides regularly, because they couldn?t find evidence of the drug in their bodies.

However, almost 42% of new HIV infections occur in this age group, nearly 80% of these live in sub-Saharan Africa and more than 70% of these infections occur in adolescent girls and young women.  Not only do these adolescent girls and young women have higher rates of HIV, they also acquire infection 5-7 years earlier than their male peers. </p>', NULL, 4, '<p><center><img src=\"imagesBIO/HIVMercuryPrinceHarryDurban.jpg\"></center></p><p><i> Britain\'s Prince Harry meets HIV youth activists at the 2016 International Aids Conference at the Durban International Conference Centre, in July. Studies suggest that age-disparate heterosexual relationships may play a role in the prevalence of HIV among teenage girls and young women.</i></p> \n<p>Worldwide there are some declining trends in HIV infections in the 15-24 year age group with simultaneous behaviour changes such as waiting longer to become sexually active, having fewer multiple sex partners and an increased use of condoms in multiple partnerships.   However, in South Africa the declines in the number of HIV positive young women are too slow and too little, with similarly low levels of behaviour change. For example the results from the National South African Household HIV Survey conducted in 2012 showed 11.4% of young women compared to 2.9% of boys in the 15-24 year age group were HIV positive, whilst in the 2008 survey, 13.9% of young women compared to 3.6% of young boys were HIV positive. These differences are minor.  </p>\n<p>Despite high levels of knowledge on HIV prevention and transmission, adolescent girls and young women are a key population who remain highly vulnerable to HIV.  A key gateway to HIV prevention and treatment is knowledge of HIV status and this remains low in South Africa.  This disconnect is related to the low risk perception,  perpetuates vulnerability to HIV within challenging environments of high levels of household poverty and unemployment that are complexly linked to embedded gender inequalities, gender based violence, harmful gender norms, patriarchy and premature attrition from schools that limit young women and girls from reaching their full potential.  </p>\n<p>The persistently high gender imbalance of HIV amongst young people has led to an increase in research to better understand the disparate burden and associated risks facing adolescent girls and young women.  Increasing attention has been paid to the role that age-disparate heterosexual relationships may play in this gender imbalance. Several studies across a variety of settings have shown that larger age differences among sex partners are associated with lower condom use and higher rates of sexually transmitted infections among adolescent girls and young women.   Recent data from the third National HIV Communication Survey conducted in 2012 suggest that women aged 16-24 years in age-disparate partnerships were more likely to report unprotected sex, amplifying transmission risk. In contrast another study from the same region, however, found that age-disparate partnerships did not predict HIV acquisition among young women in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.</p>\n<p>The study from the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) provides new evidence and sheds light on why young women in South Africa are at high risk of HIV infection <a href=\"http://www.bioafrica.net/publications.php?pubid=139\">(de Oliveira et al. Lancet HIV 2016)</a>. A large study undertaken between 2014 and 2015 involved nearly 10 000 randomly sampled people within two districts in the province KwaZulu-Natal between 2014 and 2015.  The overall HIV prevalence among 15-49 year olds in these districts was 36% and as high as 66% among women in their thirties. The difference in HIV prevalence among men and women was greatest in the young age groups, reinforcing that women in this community on average acquire HIV at a younger age than men.  The genetic sequences of the viruses from the HIV blood samples were analysed and this information was used to map the sexual partnerships among the people living with HIV to better understand the relentless spread of HIV in this community.  A total of 90 clusters of probable male?female transmission were identified, and within those clusters were 123 women and 103 men. Among the women aged under 25 years, their sexual partners were on average 8.7 years older, with 62% of these men aged 25-40 years. Among the women aged 25-40 years, their sexual partners were on average just 1 year older. Among the men aged 25-40 years linked to a woman aged under 25 years, 39% were linked simultaneously to a woman aged 25-40 years. The most probable direction of transmission among these individuals was inferred by the levels of HIV prevalence within this community.  HIV transmission was most likely to occur from high to low prevalence. Together, these data suggest that any men aged 25-40 years living with HIV may have acquired HIV from a woman aged 25-40 years, and that most of the younger women aged under 25 years living with HIV may have acquired HIV from a man aged 25-40 years. Over time, as the younger women grow older, this cycle is expected to continue.  Greater understanding of the sexual networks driving HIV transmission could help in the design of programmes to reduce HIV infection in adolescent girls and young women.</p>\n<p>This study revealed that the \'cycle of HIV transmission\' heightening the vulnerability of adolescent girls and young women\'s to HIV is driven by high rates of new HIV infections from men, on average 8 years older. Many of these men were also partners of similarly aged women who have HIV prevalence rates exceeding 60%.   </p>\n<p>Young women are uniquely vulnerable to infection, and understanding the cycle of HIV transmission for this key population is a public health imperative, despite South Africa\'s substantial progress in the large scale roll-out of HIV prevention and treatment programmes.  Several programmes such as DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe Women) Partnership, Global Fund, Adolescent Girls and Young Women\'s Programme, Girl Effect and SheConquers are comprehensive evidence based programmes for adolescent girls and young women that aim to provide sexuality education, increase and retain girls in school, reduce teenage pregnancies and gender-based violence, increase economic opportunities for young people and most importantly interrupt the cycle of transmission and decrease new HIV infections. </p>\n<p>This study provides scientific evidence, using state-of-the-art research technologies, to guide targeted HIV prevention interventions to break the cycle of HIV transmission and impact the course for HIV in South Africa and potentially in other high burden settings.</p>', 'Mercury, news, durban, hiv, infection, young woman, ', NULL, ''),

However, more than 3.5 million people are estimated to be still using zidovudine, often switching to TDF without plasma HIV-1 RNA monitoring if their CD4 cell counts remain stable. Furthermore, stavudine can select for the Lys65Arg mutation in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, which aff ects subsequent TDF activity.</p>\n<p>Gregson and colleagues\' study builds on an important previous report, the results of which showed an alarmingly high prevalence of drug resistance in people who had treatment failure on TDF-containing first-line regimens, with the highest proportion of resistance (up to 57%) identifi ed in sub-Saharan Africa.3 People who have treatment failure on first-line ART with either efavirenz or nevirapine in Africa typically have high prevalence of resistance against nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and NNRTIs, including more than 70% of patients with at least one mutation and 50% with dual-class resistance.4</p>\n<p>Previously undisclosed ART exposure and failure with NNRTIs could be the major driver of TAM selection and associated resistance in these apparently first-line cases of treatment failure. Patients with TAMs had signifi cantly lower CD4 cell counts at baseline than did patients without TAMs, the presence of TAMs was unrelated to HIV-1 subtype (most patients had subtype C), and the prevalence of NNRTI resistance was not signifi cantly increased in women who received single-dose nevirapine for the prevention of mother-tochild transmission of HIV.</p>\n<p>Transmitted HIV-1 resistance is not routinely screened for in sub-Saharan Africa, whereas screening is specifi cally recommended in well-resourced countries.5 In the absence of pretreatment resistance screening, the recommendation is to avoid use of NNRTIs. Nonetheless, NNRTIs are actually the preferred and so far only initial regimens available in most countries in the region.2</p>\n<p>Gregson and colleagues claim that doing resistance testing could mitigate the emergence and spread of such resistant viruses. Early detection of failure helps to limit the accumulation of resistance. Although implementation of point-of-care routine viral load measurements and resistance tests would obviously be welcome, they would only partly mitigate the emergence of these dual-class resistant strains that jeopardise the eff ectiveness of standard second-line ART. Implementation of these essential measures will need extra budgets and time, but time to prevent the spread of these resistant strains might be limited.</p>\n<p>Strategies to prevent HIV-1 resistance are a global priority. After the scale-up of ART in Africa, increasing numbers of patients have pretreatment drug resistance. However, networks monitoring this issue face challenges in the form of funding limitations, constraints on human resources, vulnerable health infrastructure, and drug stock-outs.6 Furthermore, individual-level resistance testing before ART initiation is generally considered not to be cost-eff ective, irrespective of the cost-eff ectiveness threshold used.7 Although optimum resource allocation to reduce HIV-1 incidence, mainly through treatment-as-prevention, is being fi ne-tuned, local prevalence of HIV-1 resistance could reverse all these benefi ts. Needless to say, concern over resistance should not stop the expansion of ART availability, but the prevalence of resistance is projected to increase substantially.8</p>\n<p>The lessons learned from tuberculosis cannot be allowed to fall into oblivion. In the African region, which has the highest burden of HIV-associated tuberculosis, the selection of resistant tuberculosis has achieved alarming rates. Some countries report multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 5% of new cases and 25% among previously treated patients.9 The HIV-1 epidemic has the potential to resemble tuberculosis in this region. Transmission of HIV-1 resistance has been limited in the fi rst years of ART scale-up, but the prevalence of resistance is heterogeneous (1.1-12.3%), failure of fi rst-line ART ranges from 15-35% at 48 weeks,10 and development of resistance after failure is high.1,11 The odds ratio for HIV-1 resistance associated with each additional year since the start of ART roll-out in this region is 1.38 (95% CI 1.13-1.68).11 Resistance surveillance and prevention is therefore a priority.</p>\n<p>WHO still recommends efavirenz plus TDF plus lamivudine (or emtricitabine) as the preferred fi rst-line regimen. However, dolutegravir has been introduced for the fi rst time as part of alternative regimens.2 This new integrase inhibitor has superior effi cacy to efavirenz and low toxicity, making it a preferred option worldwide.5 Dolutegravir has a unique feature of particular interest in Africa: in triple-drug regimens it does not select for resistance at the failure of initial ART. So far, none of 1366 patients included in phase 2/3 studies for 48-144 weeks has developed resistance to either the integrase or the reverse transcriptase.12 This high barrier against the development of resistance in initial therapy could be live-saving in sub-Saharan Africa if properly used. Generic dolutegravir received tentative approval from the US Food and Drug Administration in September, 2016, allowing the product to be launched in the US President\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief market. This is a one-of-a-kind agreement between innovator and generic companies whereby the generic version has been launched only about 3 years after the original product. While stakeholders are escalating the implementation of human and infrastructure networks in sub-Saharan Africa, a straightforward and cost-eff ective measure to limit new HIV-1 resistance would be to scale up the substitution of efavirenz for generic dolutegravir in initial ART.</p>\n\n\n<p><center><a href=\"http://www.bioafrica.net/manuscripts/CommentHIVdrugresistance_NRTI_SouthAfrica_LancetID2016.pdf\"><img src=\"imagesBIO/lancetIDDrugResistance2016.jpg\"></center></p><br>\n\n', 'comment, lancet id, hiv drug resistance paper, bioafrica, de oliveira, sub-saharan africa, Lancet, HIV-1, tenofovir, paper, commentary, bioafrica,comment, lancet id, hiv drug resistance paper, bioafrica, de oliveira, sub-saharan africa, Lancet, HIV-1, tenofovir, paper, commentary, bioafrica,comment, lancet id, hiv drug resistance paper, bioafrica, de oliveira, sub-saharan africa, Lancet, HIV-1, tenofovir, paper, commentary, bioafrica,comment, lancet id, hiv drug resistance paper, bioafrica, de oliveira, sub-saharan africa, Lancet, HIV-1, tenofovir, paper, commentary, bioafrica,comment, lancet id, hiv drug resistance paper, bioafrica, de oliveira, sub-saharan africa, Lancet, HIV-1, tenofovir, paper, commentary, bioafrica', NULL, ''),

The findings in this study in Aruba show a large increase in the prevalence of K103N mutations from 2010 to 2015.  But even the prevalence at 26% in 2010 is alarmingly high, so my question is, what did they do then? How did they act based on these data?

Recognised as an expert on HIV genetic data and bioinformatics software development, he received his PhD at the Nelson R.

De Oliveira leads a group of 18 researchers and/or postgraduate students.</p>\n\n<p>The concept for KRISP started in discussions with the executives of UKZN, CAPRISA, TIA and the Department of Science and Technology, funded by the South African Research Infrastructure Roadmap (SARIR) DIPLOMICS programme.</p>\n\n<p><b><i>\'We decided that it was wise to build KRISP on our strength in genomics, epidemiology and bioinformatics and to use our existing facilities at the School of Laboratory Medicine and Medical Sciences in the College of Health Sciences to host it,\'</i></b> said de Oliveira.</p>\n\n<p>The vision of KRISP is to produce and analyse omics data at the same speed and quality as the top genomics centres in the world. This will produce cutting-edge research, support industrial development and capacitate the next generation of scientists in South Africa.</p>\n\n<p>A critical function of KRISP will be to enable and facilitate access to genomics, epigenetics and bioinformatics technology to a broader community of users who might not otherwise pursue these technologies or use alternative international resources.  KRISP aims at creating, in collaboration with TIA, a professionally run and accredited service component that is available for academic, commercial and industrial clients.</p>\n\n<p>This agreement will see TIA providing R5 million a year for the core of the facility, but there is now opportunity to leverage additional funding for flagship projects, including a flagship programme from the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC). The SAMRC Flagship programme has been very successful - it has published 60 manuscripts, graduated nine MScs and PhD students and trained 1 150 participants as part of capacity building workshops in the last three years.

However, it remains unclear whether inter-subtype recombinants tend to randomly inherit particular genome regions from their parental genomes, or whether some genomic regions from particular subtypes tend to occur more frequently in recombinants than what would be expected under random recombination in the absence of selection.</p> \n<p>To differentiate between these two possibilities, we analysed the distribution within 79 circulating and 229 unique recombinant forms of genome fragments derived from subtype A, B, C, D, F, G and CRF01_AE viruses. We used a permutation-based test to identify genome regions that tended to be more frequently inherited from particular subtypes than could be accounted for by chance under random recombination. </p> \n<p>While genome fragments derived from each of the subtypes were scattered throughout the analysed recombinant genomes, statistically significant hot-spots of subtypes A and 01_AE derived sequences was detected in gp120, in RT for subtypes B and D, in vif for subtype C, in p24 for subtype F and in prot for subtype G. Conversely, statistically significant cold-spots were identified in vpu for subtype A derived sequences, in p24 and vif for subtype B, in RT for subtype C, in Nef for subtype D, in p17 and vpu for subtype F, in RT and p15 for subtype G and in RT for CRF01_AE. </p> \n<p>The apparent non-randomness in the frequencies which different subtypes have contributed particular genome regions to known HIV-1M recombinants suggests that selection may either favour or disfavour the survival of inter-subtype recombinants. </p> \n\n<p>Corresponding Author:<br>\nMarcel Tongo Passo, PhD<br>\nKRISP.

Little is known about the HIV-1 in Eastern Europe, but a few studies have shown that non-B subtypes are quite common. In Albania, where a recent study estimated a ten-fold increase of AIDS incidence during the last six years, subtype A and B account for 90% of the know infections.\n\n</p><p><i>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: </i>We investigated the demographic history of HIV-1 subtype A and B in Albania by using a statistical framework based on coalescent theory and phylogeography. High-resolution phylogenetic and molecular clock analysis showed a limited introduction to the Balkan country of subtype A during the late 1980s followed by an epidemic outburst in the early 1990 s. In contrast, subtype B was apparently introduced multiple times between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s. Both subtypes are growing exponentially, although the HIV-1A epidemic displays a faster growth rate, and a significantly higher basic reproductive number R(0). HIV-1A gene flow occurs primarily from the capital Tirane, in the center of the country, to the periphery, while HIV-1B flow is characterized by a balanced exchange between center and periphery. Finally, we calculated that the actual number of infections in Albania is at least two orders of magnitude higher than previously thought.\n\n</p><p><i>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:</i> Our analysis demonstrates the power of recently developed computational tools to investigate molecular epidemiology of pathogens, and emphasize the complex factors involved in the establishment of HIV-1 epidemics. We suggest that a significant correlation exists between HIV-1 exponential spread and the socio-political changes occurred during the Balkan wars.

The HIV-1 Protease Cleavage Sites section provides information on the position, subtype variation and genetic evolution of Gag, Gag-Pol and Nef cleavage sites. \n</p><p>The HIV-1 Protein Data-mining Tool includes a set of 27 group M (subtypes A through K) reference sequences that can be used to assess the influence of genetic variation on immunological and functional domains of the protein. The BLAST Structure Tool identifies proteins with similar, experimentally determined topologies, and the Tools Directory provides a categorized list of websites and relevant software programs. \n</p><p>This combined database and software repository is designed to facilitate the capture, retrieval and analysis of HIV-1 protein data, and to convert it into clinically useful information relating to the pathogenesis, transmission and therapeutic response of different HIV-1 variants.

Seven cleavage sites (p17/p24, p24/p2, NC/p1, NC/TFP, PR/RT, RT/p66, and p66/IN) were well conserved over time and in all HIV-1 subtypes. One site (p1/p6(gag)) exhibited moderate variation, and four sites (p2/NC, TFP/p6(pol), p6(pol)/PR, and Nef) were highly variable, both within and between subtypes. Three of the variable sites are known to be major determinants of polyprotein processing and virion production. P2/NC controls the rate and order of cleavage, p6(gag) is an important phosphoprotein required for virion release, and TFP/p6(pol), a novel cleavage site in the transframe domain, influences the specificity of Gag-Pol processing and the activation of protease.

While methods exist to detect episodic diversifying selection and continuous directional selection, no evolutionary model combining these two properties has been proposed. We present two models of episodic directional selection (MEDS and EDEPS) which allow the a priori specification of lineages expected to have undergone directional selection.</p> \n<p>The models infer the sites and target residues that were likely subject to directional selection, using either codon or protein sequences. Compared to its null model of episodic diversifying selection, MEDS provides a superior fit to most sites known to be involved in drug resistance, and neither one test for episodic diversifying selection nor another for constant directional selection are able to detect as many true positives as MEDS and EDEPS while maintaining acceptable levels of false positives. This suggests that episodic directional selection is a better description of the process driving the evolution of drug resistance.</p>\n<p><b>Author Summary</b></p>\n<p>When exposed to treatment, HIV-1 and other rapidly evolving viruses have the capacity to acquire drug resistance mutations (DRAMs), which limit the efficacy of antivirals. There are a number of experimentally well characterized HIV-1 DRAMs, but many mutations whose roles are not fully understood have also been reported. In this manuscript we construct evolutionary models that identify the locations and targets of mutations conferring resistance to antiretrovirals from viral sequences sampled from treated and untreated individuals. While the evolution of drug resistance is a classic example of natural selection, existing analyses fail to detect the majority of DRAMs. We show that, in order to identify resistance mutations from sequence data, it is necessary to recognize that in this case natural selection is both episodic (it only operates when the virus is exposed to the drugs) and directional (only mutations to a particular amino-acid confer resistance while allowing the virus to continue replicating). The new class of models that allow for the episodic and directional nature of adaptive evolution performs very well at recovering known DRAMs, can be useful at identifying unknown resistance-associated mutations, and is generally applicable to a variety of biological scenarios where similar selective forces are at play.</p>', 'PLoS Comput Biol', ' 8(5)', 10, NULL, 'Murrell_Direction_Selection_HIVDR_2012', 'Modeling, HIV-1, Drug, Resistance , Episodic, positive, darwinian, Directional, Selection', 'Modeling HIV-1 Drug Resistance as Episodic Directional Selection.

We compared gender differences in mortality among HIV+ patients on ART with mortality in an age-standardised HIV-negative population.</p>\n\n<p>Among 46,201 adults (65% female, median age 35 years), during 77,578 person-years of follow-up, men had lower median CD4+ cell counts than women (85 versus 110 cells/ul, p<0.001), were more likely to be classified WHO stage III/IV (86 versus 77%, p<0.001), and had higher mortality in crude (8.5 versus 5.7 deaths/100 person-years, p<0.001) and adjusted analyses (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.31, 95% CI 1.22?1.41). After 36 months on ART, men were more likely than women to be truly LTF (AHR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12?1.28) but not to die after LTF (AHR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86?1.25). Findings were consistent across all eight programmes. Virologic suppression was similar by gender; women had slightly better immunologic responses than men. Notably, the observed gender differences in mortality on ART were smaller than gender differences in age-standardised death rates in the HIV-negative South African population. Over time, non-HIV mortality appeared to account for an increasing proportion of observed mortality. The analysis was limited by missing data on baseline HIV disease characteristics, and we did not observe directly mortality in HIV-negative populations where the participating cohorts were located.</p>\n\n<p><b><i>Conclusions</b></i></p>\n<p>HIV-infected men have higher mortality on ART than women in South African programmes, but these differences are only partly explained by more advanced HIV disease at the time of ART initiation, differential LTF and subsequent mortality, and differences in responses to treatment. The observed differences in mortality on ART may be best explained by background differences in mortality between men and women in the South African population unrelated to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>', 'PLoS Medicine', '9(9)', NULL, NULL, 'PLosMed_gender_ARV_2012', 'Gender, Differences, Survival, Adult, Patients, Starting, Antiretroviral, Therapy, South Africa', 'Gender Differences in Survival among Adult Patients Starting Antiretroviral Therapy in South Africa: A Multicentre Cohort Study\r\n', 'e1001304', NULL, 2012, NULL, 13.05, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

Drug resistance may be primary (transmitted), whereby a person is infected by a strain of HIV that is not fully susceptible to antiretroviral medications (ARVs), or secondary (acquired), whereby a person develops resistance to ARVs over time. In South Africa, the level of primary resistance has been below 5% for the last decade and so this article will focus on the more pressing problem of secondary resistance. </p>\n<p>In Southern Africa, routine viral-load monitoring is recommended to identify treatment failure but it is often not done with sufficient frequency, nor reacted to appropriately.

This is in part because of a lack of certainty regarding the reason for treatment failure ? whether it is due to poor patient adherence, the development of drug resistance, or a combination of these issues. Nonetheless, patients who continue taking a failing ART regimen are at risk of developing resistance to those medications. This article reviews the South African guidelines for viral load monitoring and regimen switch and introduces basic concepts of drug resistance for nurses and health care workers.

We summarise all available HIV prevention methods and make recommendations on how to address current challenges.</p>\r<p><b><i>Discussion: </b></i>In the early days of the epidemic, behavioural approaches to control the HIV dominated, and the few available evidence-based interventions demonstrated to reduce HIV transmission were applied independently from one another. More recently, it has become clear that combination prevention strategies targeted to high transmission geographies and people at most risk of infections are required to achieve epidemic control. Biomedical strategies such as male medical circumcision and antiretroviral therapy for treatment in HIV-positive individuals and as pre- exposure prophylaxis in HIV-negative individuals provide immense promise for the future of HIV control. In resource- rich settings, the threat of HIV treatment optimism resulting in increased sexual risk taking has been observed and there are concerns that as ART roll-out matures in resource-poor settings and the benefits of ART become clearly visible, behavioural disinhibition may also become a challenge in those settings. Unfortunately, an efficacious vaccine, a strategy which could potentially halt the HIV epidemic, remains elusive.</p>\r<p><b><i>Conclusion: </b></i>Combination HIV prevention offers a logical approach to HIV control, although what and how the available options should be combined is contextual.

South Africa currently has the largest number of people living with HIV in the world and the epidemic is dominated by a unique subtype, HIV-1 subtype C. This large epidemic is also characterized by high level of genetic diversity. We hypothesize that this diversity is due to multiple introductions of the virus during the period of change. In this paper, we apply novel phylogeographic methods to estimate the number of viral imports and exportsfrom the start of the epidemic to the present.</p>\n<p><b><i>METHODS:</p></b></i>\n<p>We assembled 11,289 unique subtype C pol sequences from southern Africa. These represent one of the largest sequence datasets ever analyzed in the region. Sequences were stratified based on country of sampling and levels of genetic diversity were estimated for each country. Sequences were aligned and a maximum-likelihood evolutionary tree was inferred. Least-Squares Dating was then used to obtain a dated phylogeny from which we estimated the number of introductions into and exports out of South Africa using parsimony-based ancestral location reconstructions.</p>\n<p><b><i>RESULTS:</p></b></i>\n<p>Our results identified 189 viral introductions into South Africa with the largest number of introductions attributed to Zambia (n=109), Botswana (n=32), Malawi (n=26) and Zimbabwe (n=13).

HIV WGS from patients failing on different antiretroviral treatments were compared to sequences derived from individuals naïve to the respective treatment.\n</p><p><b><i>RESULTS:</b></i> GWAS methodology was validated by identifying five associations on a genetic level that led to amino acid changes known to cause DR. Further, we highlighted the ability of GWAS to identify epistatic effects, identifying two replicable variants within amino acid 68 of the reverse transcriptase protein previously described as potential fitness compensatory mutations. A possible additional DR variant within amino acid 91 of the matrix region of the Gag protein was associated with tenofovir failure, highlighting GWAS\'s ability to identify variants outside classical candidate genes.

It is still unknown how global HIV populations will respond over the long-term when confronted with efficiently protective vaccines and drug therapies.</p><p> It is entirely possible that divergent HIV variants that are presently circulating in diversity hotspots such as Cameroon and the DRC might be the source of future global multi-drug resistant or vaccine evasion re-emergence events. In an effort to discover and characterise more of these highly divergent lineages, we recently performed in-depth characterisation of HIV-1 diversity in Cameroon. </p><p>We found that 10% of gag sequences and 5% of nef sequences were not easily classifiable into any of the known HIV-1M clades. In addition, the full length characterisation of 24 unique recombinant forms (URFs) from Cameroon showed that these divergent sequences contained large tracts of sequence that could not be credibly classified as having been derived from parental viruses in the known subtypes. Furthermore, we have found that many of the sequence fragments occurring within CRF04_cpx, CRF06_cpx, CRF11_cpx, CRF18_cpx, CRF25_cpx, CRF27_cpx and CRF49_cpx are in fact likely derived from divergent unclassified parental lineages that may pre-date the current subtypes, even though they are presently identified as derived from currently defined HIV-1M subtypes. </p><p>The highly divergent sequence tracts evident within these various HIV-1M genomes might be the extant descendants of pre-epidemic HIV-1 group M lineages (i.e. they may, in a sense, be evolutionary relics). This suggests that large pools of undiscovered HIV-1M genetic diversity likely exist throughout equatorial West Africa. </p><p>We hypothesise that viruses belonging to these lineages may have gone largely undetected because of their low pathogenicity and/or transmissibility: characteristics that would be expected to result in the long-term survival of individuals that they manage to infect.

Mutations K101P, K103N, V106M, Y188L, G190S and M230L caused high-level resistance to efavirenz and nevirapine, while Y181C/I/V, Y188C/L and G190S conferred high-level resistance to nevirapine only. Mutation V179F conferred hyper-susceptibility to all three NNRTIs (FC=0.004-0.151). Mutation Y188C, although conferring high level resistance to nevirapine (FC>40), conferred hypersusceptibility to etravirine (FC=0.144). All eight double mutations caused high-level resistance to nevirapine (FC>40), and some to efavirenz. Interestingly, the combination of V179F with Y181C caused a high level of resistance to both etravirine (FC=>40) and nevirapine (FC>40). The Y181C and G190S double mutant was the only other combination that caused high-level resistance to etravirine (FC>40).<br>\r\r<p><b>Conclusion:</p></b> NNRTI resistance mutations, either singly or in combination, that arise in response to nevirapine or efavirenz rarely conferred high levels of resistance to etravirine. However, the combinations of V179F/Y181C and G190S/Y188C conferred high level resistance to ETV, as has previously been predicted. As combinations are not prevalent in currently failing individuals, etravirine is a suitable option for first-line NNRTI-based regimen salvage.<br>\r', '<p><b>Background:</p></b> South Africa has an estimated 5.7 million people infected with HIV-1 of whom 919,923 were receiving antiretroviral treatment by the end of 2009.

On a technical level, this is because drug efficacy is a common property resource: one that is difficult to bar people from using, but that does run out if we overuse it. We all want to believe that the drugs we rely upon will keep working no matter how much we use them or misuse them. Further, many actors make deci- sions that determine the trajectory of drug resistance that impose invisible costs to society, thereby lulling us into complacency. On a human level, it is hard to see that people are dying from drug resistance, but they are. As with climate change, we now understand the science of drug resistance well enough to act, but the policy response has eluded us.</p>\r<p>The Center for Global Development\'s global health work focuses on issues where donors can benefit from expert techni- cal advice and detailed analysis to guide decisions about resource investments. This report is an example. The Drug Resistance Working Groupi was convened in late 2007 to identify practical and feasible ways for donors, multilateral organizations, non- governmental organizations, and private companies to prevent or contain resistance to drugs for infectious diseases affecting developing countries.</p>\r<p>The highly accomplished members of the Working Group came to this task with a wide range of specialized knowledge. They acknowledged the difficulties of tackling drug resistance from a perch in Washington, Boston, London, and even Accra, but insisted that the recommendations include both global actions and local solutions that hold the potential to alter the culture of how we use medicines worldwide. In the course of their discus- sions, Working Group members carefully examined the common drivers of drug resistance that plague treatment efforts for many infectious diseases, particularly in developing countries. As a result, their recommendations emphasize common, cross-disease approaches, rather than vertical, disease-specific actions.</p>\n<p>The full report is open accessible at the <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1424207\">Centre for Global Development Website</a>.\r\n\n', '<p>In an increasingly interconnected world, problems with drug resistance have moved from the patient\'s bedside to threaten global public health.

These patients start ART with a compromised arsenal of ARVs. Therefore in resource-rich settings where TDR levels are higher, it is recommended that patients are genotyped before they can be initiated onto ART. This helps the physicians personalize the regimens based on the resistance profiles identified. However, this cannot be done in resource-limited settings, which have the greatest burdens of HIV. Therefore routine surveillance programs to monitor the levels of TDR at a population level to support the public health approach to ART have been recommended. A number of publications reporting on the prevalence to TDR in different settings have sequences that are made publicly available through Genbank. </p>\r\r<p><b><i>The GIS Tool</b></i></p>\r<p>The GIS tool developed by the Stanford team generates spatial temporal data on the prevalence of TDR from studies published in different settings across the globe. The studies included had publicly available HIV-1 RT ± protease sequences from well-characterized representative populations of untreated HIV-1-infected individuals for which the country and year of virus isolation were available. Studies with epidemiologically linked patients were excluded as well as studies with study populations > 25 years of age. Currently the GIS tool is generating the prevalence from sequences from more that 30,000 treatment naïve patients published in more than 213 peer-reviewed articles. These studies have been published from both resource-rich and resource-limited settings. Each study included in the GIS tool is represented as a circle on the map. The size of the circle corresponds to the sample size and color to the prevalence of TDR. </p>\r\r<p><b><i>Results </b></i></p>\r<p>Data focusing on studies from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South East Asia (SEA) generated by the GIS tool was recently presented at the 19th CROI (03-08 March, 2012). 82 studies from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and 39 from South / Southeast Asia (SSEA) met inclusion criteria. The 82 SSA studies included 9,179 individuals (median 71 per study). The SSA studies were most frequently conducted in South Africa (ZA; n=12), Cameroon (CM; n=7) and Uganda (UG; n=7). In 30 additional SSA countries, 1 to 3 studies were conducted. Eight studies included individuals from more than one country (Figure 1).</p>\r<p>The 39 SSEA studies included 3,189 individuals (median 57 per study). The 39 SSEA studies were conducted in China (CN; n=10), India (IN; n=10), Vietnam (VN; n=7), Thailand (TH; n=3), Cambodia (KH; n=2), and Malaysia (MY; n=2).

The most common subtypes in SSEA were CRF01_AE, followed by subtype C, subtype B, and two B/C CRFs (CRF_07 and CRF_08), and B/01 recombinants.</p>\r\r<p>Prevalence of genotypic resistance: The median proportion of individuals per study having > 1 SDRMs was 3.2% for SSA (IQR: 1.1% to 5.7%) and 2.4% for SSEA (IQR: 0.6% to 6.1%). In both SSA and SSEA, the prevalence of NNRTI SDRM increased with year of virus sampling (OR=1.003; p<0.001 for both regions). In SSA, but not in SEA, the prevalence of NRTI SDRM increased with year of virus sampling (OR=1.003; p=0.005). There were no temporal trends in the prevalence of PI SDRM in either region .</p>\r\r<p>The collation and analysis of data collected over time and from various geographic settings provides more insight on the impact of the increased access to ART on the patterns and levels of TDR than the analysis of individual studies. Although there is an overall upward trend in the levels of TDR in both SSA and SEA, TDR levels are still low, <5%. This analysis also confirms recently published data from South Africa that also showed that TDR levels in South are still less than 5%. However, there is need for more vigilance in monitoring TDR especially in SSA as there are some individual studies that have shown levels TDR surpassing the 5% threshold. In addition, the numbers of patients on ART have been increasing exponentially during the past ten years necessitating closer monitoring of the ART programmes.</p>\r\r\r<p><b><i>Sources:</b></i></p>\r<p>1.	<a href=\"http://hivdb.stanford.edu/surveillance/map/\">http://hivdb.stanford.edu/surveillance/map/</a></p>\r<p>2.

The workshop presented on 22nd May 2012 was targeted at nurses and health care workers from 17 clinics around the Hlabisa sub/district and aimed at equipping them to deal effectively with HIV drug resistance. The workshop was very well attended with 58 participants, which meant that we ran at our auditorium full capacity. The main focus of this workshop was to give nurses and health workers the necessary knowledge to handle HIV drug resistance in children. The programme ranged from the scientific background of HIV drug resistance, from nutrition and growth in children and its correlation with HIV drug resistance, to a more practical session with role-plays, where the teams produced a theater play out how to deal with drug resistance from a clinical, social and psychological point of view.  </p>\n<p>In addition, Dr. Siva Danaviah (Africa Centre, Durban) delivered a very impressive presentation on how drug resistance develops in a patient. This was followed by a series of drug resistance clinical cases presented by Prof. Ruth Bland (Pediatrician and clinical research leader of Africa Centre). The issue of disclosure ranked high in the discussions and a disclosure section was led and presented by Dr Tamsen Rochat (Psychologist) and Dumo Mkhwanazi (PhD candidate). During this section, they presented helpful steps on how one can go about disclosing the child HIV status. </p>\n<p>One of the main focuses of the workshop was to highlight that a detectable viral load result is an emergency situation and that a detectable viral load while on ARVs means that resistance is likely to develop. The workshop generated great discussion and increased awareness of this subject. <b><i>\"This workshop has been helpful to me, especially since I work closely with patients on ARVs and my task is to educate patients about the importance of taking ARVs and most importantly let them know that taking ARVs is a long term commitment\"</b></i>, said Mthunzi Mlambo, a clinic HIV counsellor. He continued on to say <b><i>\"This workshop has changed the way I will now deal with my patients, in particular on issues of disclosure and their viral load results\".</b></i></p>\n<p>This comes after a successful meeting between SATuRN and South Africa Department of Health at the end of April, where HIV drug resistance ranked as one of the highest priorities of the DOH. Consequently, the DOH is seeking to upscale HIV resistance testing and SATuRN will continue to host more workshops of this nature among the 17 clinics decentralized across the Hlabisa sub district as well as in the Free State province. The HIV drug resistance team has been working tirelessly to identify patients failing ART, organizing ART failure camps in the 17 clinics, and now hosting workshops, which will continue throughout the year. For this, the resistance team would like to thank the DOH and the DOH staff for their continued support for this initiative.

One of these is antiretroviral drug resistance .</p>\n<p>Based on Prof. Susan Engelbrecht\'s longstanding interest in HIV diversity, Prof. Wolfgang Preiser\'s experience with diagnosing and managing drug resistance in the U.K. and in Germany (where resistance testing is part of routine patient management), and Dr. Gert van Zyl\'s first-hand clinical involvement and interest in epidemiology, the Division developed HIV drug resistance as a new research theme.</p>\n<p>This theme comprises a number of different aspects. Because genotypic resistance testing through sequencing is technically demanding and commercially available assays are expensive and may not perform well in our setting, an in house method which is better yet cheaper than comparable commercial tests was developed as part of a Master\'s project and is now being used routinely. </p>\n<p>Tygerberg Virology is currently one of only two NHLS laboratories performing routine diagnostic HIV drug resistance testing. It performs approximately 80 tests per month, no mean feat for a very demanding test which, in addition to the laboratory side, requires the complex task of interpreting results in the context of the individual patient\'s treatment history. The number of requests for this highly specialised service is expected to increase further once guidelines on resistance testing are released by the SA HIV Clinicians Society.</p>\n<p>The Division is conducting systematic surveillance in different groups of patients. Given that the \"public health approach\" means that patients receive standardised antiretroviral treatment regimens, the aim is to generate reliable data to inform future changes to the treatment protocol.</p>\n<p>It was found that of mothers who received a dual regimen for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, combining short-course zidovudine with single-dose nevirapine, only half as many (17.1%) developed resistance to the latter compared to mothers not receiving the zidovudine component. This is another significant advantage of the combined regimen, in addition to reducing the risk of neonatal infection.</p>\n<p>A high rate of resistance mutations was found in pre-treatment Tanzanian patients not fulfilling the WHO criteria for transmitted resistance threshold surveys. This suggests that baseline resistance may be more common than would be expected from such surveys alone. WHO is currently considering a revision of surveillance recommendations for transmitted HIV drug resistance, to take into account these findings.</p>\n<p>Overall however the results obtained so far are encouraging, demonstrating that antiretroviral drug resistance is not yet a major problem for most South African HIV patients. However, as the South African public sector treatment programme grows and the treated cohort \"matures\", more patients will develop resistance. In parallel, a larger proportion of new infections will then be acquired from those failing therapy and harbouring resistant virus.</p>\n<p>A new publication on <a href=\"http://www.bioafrica.net/report.php?id=14\">deep sequencing shed light on low levels of PI resistance in patients with poor adherence is also featured at the SATuRN 2012 report</a>.</p> \n<p>Division of Medical Virology , Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University and National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) Tygerberg</p>\n<p>PO Box 19063, Tygerberg 7505, SOUTH AFRICA</p>\n<p>Tel: +27 21 938 9353, Fax: +27 21 938 9361</p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"http://www.sun.ac.za/virology\">http://www.sun.ac.za/virology</a></p>\n<p>contact: Mrs Sal van Zyl, E-mail: sal@sun.ac.za</p>\n<p><b>By Wolfgang Preiser </b>(Professor and Head),\r\n<b>Gert van Zyl</b> (Senior Specialist) & <b>Susan Engelbrecht</b> (Professor and Senior Scientist</p>\n<center><p><img src=\"imagesBIO/imgreport13people.gif\" alt=\"\"></p></center>', '', 'SATuRN report 2012', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'SATuRN, Featured, Partner, Division of Medical Virology, Stellenbosh University, Wolfgang Preiser, Gert van Zyl, Susan Engelbrecht, cape town, south africa', 'SATuRN Featured Partner, Division of Medical Virology, Stellenbosh University.

Using samples from blood bank discards in Kenya and complete genome sequencing, this report further documents CRF16_A2D and related recombinants and identifies a second CRF, CRF21_A2D. The two A2-containing CRFs, and two recombinants related to CRF16_A2D, share common structural elements but appear to have been independently derived. Concerted selection may have influenced the emergence and spread of certain A2-containing strains in Kenya. The second complete subtype C sequence from Kenya is also reported here.

HIV-1 in the East Province of Cameroon is particularly diverse: in a recent study, we found a high proportion of unique recombinant forms (URFs). Herein we describe the analysis of the full-length sequences of two of these URFs, which, after preliminary analysis of gag, pol, and env fragments, appeared to be a novel CRF. This novel strain, CRF36_cpx, contains fragments that can be assigned to the CRF01_AE, CRF02_AG, and subtype A and G radiations. Forty percent of the genome can be classified as CRF02_AG, including regions in gag, pol, env, and the accessory genes. Twenty-seven percent is CRF01_AE, comprising the majority of gag, the beginning of env, and the end of env into the 3\' LTR. Twenty percent of the genome can be assigned to subtype A, with segments in pol and env. The remaining 13% of the sequence is classifiable as subtype G, in pol and vpu. The subtype A and G lineages formed by the CRF36_cpx sequences are unique and appear ancestral in nature. CRF36_cpx is both the first to combine more than one CRF and the first to include fragments of CRF02_AG. The ancestral sequences present in CRF36_cpx represent a link to extinct strains, and, potentially, insight into the evolution of HIV-1.'),
